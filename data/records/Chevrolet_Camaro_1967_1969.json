        "The Camaro was purchased in 2012 with me being the 4th owner per the titleand registration. Upon receiving the Car, Afull ground-up rotisserie restoration began with over 1000hrs invested. Any damaged or rusted components/ part were replaced with new parts.no parts were replaced with used parts/original parts. During the process, every precaution was taken to ensure longevity and performance. All bare metal was coated for both interior and exterior parts. All chassis and suspension components were powder-coated,full underbody coating and much more. The full exterior was taken down to bare metal and coated, primed, and painted at a cost of $10,498.67. The paint colors are from Dupont - Blue # BM162 and Silver # LM084 (For Reference, 1 Gal of the blue paintcost $1,189). The silver stripes are painted on and then clear-coated for a smooth transition. The Engine and drive train componentshave all been rebuilt or are new. The 496 Stoker produces 600 ft/lbs of torque and 520 Hp , backed by a Built 4L60E , with a posi rear end that has been mini tubed. The interior has added sound deadening, all new componentsand parts, with added internal and external LED dome lights.

        "This awesome first generation 1967 Chevrolet Camaro is the ultimate G-machine with a Supercharged LS3 and Art Morrison full chassis. Yes, this Camaro rides on an Art Morrison full chassis! As the original VIN number indicates this car was built in Los Angles, California as a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro Coupe with an 8-cylinder engine. WD-40 teamed up with SEMA Cares to build a very special 1967 Camaro which was also designed to pay tribute to both the SEMA Show and the Camaro's 50th Anniversary. This special 1967 Camaro was designed by Neil Tjin and built in partnership with Tjin and instructors from Universal Technical Institute. The installation of all its mechanical components was documented on PowerNation TV and was completed with help from a host of aftermarket companies including Eckler's, Budnik Wheels, Axalta, Eibach, Falken Tires, Baer Brake Systems, LR Auto Body and Optima Batteries. The car went on to debut at the SEMA Show where it was a big attraction. The car was sold a few months later and became part of a private collection. It was offered for sale with 975 test miles in August of 2024 and MS CLASSIC CARS jumped on the opportunity to purchase it. MS CLASSIC CARS gave this car a facelift during the service and detail process. December of 2024 is the first time it's been listed for sale since completion.\nThe exterior of this Camaro is truly stunning with its factory body design, vibrant color and appointments. The straight body was outfitted with a cowl style hood, flush-mounted Kindig-It silver door handles and a carbon fiber rear spoiler. It was finished in a gorgeous dark shade of Yellow which dresses it perfectly. The high quality paint was recently detailed to a glossy shine. The yellow color is complemented with black trim including the glass moldings, windshield wipers, dual mirrors, grille, front bumper, front spoiler, rear tail panel, gas cap and rear bumper. It's equipped with all new tinted glass throughout, LED headlights and taillights. All of the exterior emblems were removed for a clean appearance. It rolls on 18\u201d Budnik Tungsten Bronze Ceramic Coated wheels. The wheels are mounted to new General G-Max RS tires that are 245-40-18 on the front and 285-40-18 on the rear. As part of the facelift, MS CLASSIC CARS removed the front black vinyl stripe and added new LED headlights, LED taillights, gas cap and tires.\nThe interior of this Camaro is the perfect blend of original and custom. It sports a custom leather headliner and inner sail panels. During the restoration it was treated with a complet new black interior with a yellow painted dash and yellow trimmed bucket seats. The dash pad, door panels, center console, door sills and carpeting is factory reproduction. Some of the custom features included aftermarket gauges, black tilt steering column, NRG Innovations steering wheel, Kenwood Excelon DMX 706S head unit and Lokar silver shifter. As part of the facelift, MS CLASSIC CARS repainted the dash black and removed the original radio. MS CLASSIC CARS also added a new rear view mirror, Dakota Digital gauges, 14\u201d Billet Specialties Formula black steering wheel, Lokar black shifter, Pro Car bucket seats and the rear seat was reupholstered with a factory reproduction cover. The trunk compartment was nicely restored and outfitted with a black carpet trunk mat. The battery was relocated to the rear and sits inside a plastic enclosure.\nThe engine compartment is highly detailed throughout with many new parts. The firewall, inner fenders and radiator support were refinished in stain black. During the restoration everything was replaced new including the wiring harness. It was setup with a new GM Performance 6.2L LS3 E-Rod V8 engine and a new Vortec V3 Supercharger. The Supercharger currently is running 6 lbs. of boost which is making roughly 525hp. The engine has a Mishimoto remote oil cooler which is mounted on the front of the radiator. The engine was setup with a Holley power steering and alternator high mount system. The engine was dressed with a carbon fiber intake cover and yellow painted Roto Fab coil covers. A New Port Engineering wiper motor, Aeromotive fuel regulator and Fragola fuel pressure gauge was mounted to the firewall. The engine is cooled by a Mishimoto black aluminum radiator with dual electric fans and black aluminum overfill canister. The engine breathes through BBK ceramic shorty headers and a custom 3\u201d exhaust with Magnaflow mufflers and catalytic converters. The engine is coupled with a new GM Performance 4L65E 4-speed automatic transmission and 9\u201d nodular rear end housing. The rear end was part of the Art Morrison full chassis and was powder coated silver. As part of the facelift, MS CLASSIC CARS added a new air intake filter, radiator support show panel and overfill canister. MS CLASSIC CARS also completely serviced the engine and retuned the software program.\nThe undercarriage is also highly detailed throughout with many new parts. The floors were refinished in satin black. The body sits on a new Art Morrison full chassis which was powder coated silver. During the restoration everything was replaced new including the fuel tank, power steering system, suspension components and braking system.

A black vinyl power top tucks away cleanly, while the SS\nappearance package brings authentic muscle car elements like the\nvent-style hood.

This 1969 Camaro Z28 is great blend of both. It sports its original color of Hugger Orange with black Z28 stripes which looks awesome. It's been beautifully restored with tasteful upgrades including the wheels, interior, engine, transmission, rear end, suspension and brakes. Think of this car as a Z28 on steroids. Make sure to read the highlights and description to learn everything this car has to offer.\u201d \u2013 Marc Schiliro\nThis gorgeous 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 Custom has been restored to show quality standards and is loaded with upgrades. Although this car falls into the custom category it still has a lot of the original factory DNA. As the original Trim Tag indicates this car was built at the Norwood, Ohio factory on the third week of November in 1968 as a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro 8-cylinder Coupe with a Hugger Orange exterior and custom black interior. The monthly VIN report coincides with the build date indicated on the Trim Tag. MS CLASSIC CARS purchased this car from the previous owner who was the caretaker for the last 32 years. From the information gathered this car was an early built Z28 model which wouldn't have an X-code on the Trim Tag. The previous owner stated it was indeed a real Z28 prior to the restoration but there is no evidence to support this claim. This car was a product of a meticulous nut and bolt restoration which was completed in 2019. Since completion it's been driven roughly 1000 miles. January of 2025 is the first time it's been listed for sale.\nThe exterior of this 69 Camaro is striking with its original factory design, Hugger Orange paint and American Racing VF481 staggered polished wheels. From the information gathered this car retains all its original sheet metal with exception of the rear quarters which were replaced with NOS panels at the time of restoration. From the information gathered this car was drag raced earlier on in its life which was common and modifications were made to the rear quarters. The body sports a cowl induction hood, front spoiler and lower rear spoiler which are correct for the earlier built Camaro models. The body is very straight with excellent gap lines throughout. It was repainted in its original factory color of Hugger Orange paint with black Z28 stripes. Hugger Orange is a very desirable factory color and dresses the body so nicely. The show quality paint was recently detailed to a brilliant shine by the team at MS CLASSIC CARS. The previous owner showed this car and won awards for the paint. The front windshield was replaced new. All of the remaining glass is original with Soft-Ray stamps and in very nice overall condition. Everything on the exterior was restored or replaced new such as the glass stainless trim, wiper arms, dual mirrors, antenna, front grille, headlights, front bumper, fender trim, door handles, lower rocker moldings, rear quarter louvers, tail light bezels, rear bumper and emblems. The car has a killer stance on new American Racing Forged VF481 wheels that are 17x7 on the front and 18x9 on the rear. The wheels are wrapped with General G-Max RS tires that were replaced in 2022.\nThe interior of this 69 Camaro was completely restored to the original factory appearance with a few subtle upgrades. It was redone in its original trim of custom black which complements the exterior black stripes perfectly. Everything on the interior was restored or replaced new such as the headliner, dome light, sun visors, rear view mirror, dash pad, dash fascia, wood trim, gauges, Astro vents, 3-spoke wood steering wheel, console, door panels, pedals and carpeting. Some of the new custom touches include factory COPO style 140-mph speedometer, Autometer console gauges including volts, water temp, oil and fuel, SST shifter with black shift knob, Autosound stereo system, TMI bucket seats with matching upholstery and carpeted floor mats. The trunk compartment was nicely restored and finished with the correct style splatter paint. It was outfitted with a factory style trunk mat.\nThe engine compartment is highly detailed throughout with many custom parts. The hood pivots on aluminum hood hinges which match the wheels. The firewall, inner fenders and radiator support was finished in the correct shade of satin black. It's equipped with aluminum fender support braces which also match the hinges and wheels. The car is powered by a Fletcher built 383 V8 with Holley Terminator fuel injection management system. This engine was built with high-end internal parts such as Molnar Technologies forged crank and rods, Comp custom ground hydraulic roller cam and roller rockers, AFR 195 CNC ported aluminum heads, Edelbrock intake and throttle body, Holley Sniper ignition and coil. The orange painted block was dressed with factory style polished valve covers and air cleaner. Some other upgraded parts include a custom oil pan, aluminum water pump, front serpentine system with aluminum pulleys and brackets. The engine runs excellent and is estimated to have around 450 horsepower. The engine is cooled by an aluminum radiator with dual SPAL electric fans and aluminum overfill canister. The engine breathes through Hooker Competition ceramic long tube headers and a ceramic H-pipe dual exhaust system with Flowmaster mufflers. The engine is coupled to a Tremec TKO 600 5-speed manual transmission from Silver Sport Transmissions and is equipped with a hydraulic clutch. The power is transferred to a Dynotech drive shaft and GM 12-bolt POSI rear end with Richmond 3.73 gears. The rear end was decorated with a GM rear end differential cover.\nThe undercarriage is also highly detailed throughout with many custom parts. The floors were painted Hugger Orange to match the exterior and the sub-frame was painted black. It's equipped with a CPP power steering system. The fuel system consists of an in-tank fuel pump and stainless-steel lines. The suspension components include a Hotchkis front sway bar, Hotchkis 2\u201d drop springs and KYB Gas-A-Just shocks. The four wheel disc power braking system includes a 12\u201d booster, polished master cylinder, Right Stuff Signature black calipers with 12\u201d drilled and slotted rotors.\nAs described, this is one sweet 1969 Camaro Z28 Custom that looks, runs and drives awesome.

Bringing the fun to\na stop are Wilwood power disc brakes with slotted and drilled\nrotors on all four corners.

        "This 1968 Chevrolet Camaro is a gorgeous 2 door hardtop outfitted\nwith fantastic performance upgrades that is sure to make you an\namazing classic pony Muscle Car! In the mid-1960s, among the race\nof America's Big Three automakers to build some of the best muscle\ncars ever produced, a new sub-genre of muscle cars-the Pony\nCar-were introduced when Ford introduced its Mustang. Sporty, cool,\naffordable, and youth-oriented are all descriptors of the Pony Car\nand early on, they were massive sales successes. At first, only two\nof the three Big Three even offered a Pony Car, Ford had its\nMustang and Chrysler (through its Plymouth marque) had the\nBarracuda. However, General Motors, the biggest of the Big Three,\ndid not quite have its own Pony Car. Specifically, Chevrolet's\nleadership realized that the Corvair and the Chevy II/Nova were not\nquite cutting it as far as a true Pony Car competitor. That all\nchanged in 1967 when Chevy introduced its own Pony Car, the Camaro.\nThe Camaro essentially replicated the traditional pony car formula\nconsisting of a small, sporty body paired with a high performance\ndrivetrain, all for a modest price. As could be expected, the\nCamaro was a major success for the GM marque with over two-hundred\nthousand units sold in that first year. Hoping to coast off the\ntailwinds of the 1967 Camaro, Chevrolet opted for minimal changes\nin its 1968 reprise of the mega-hit Camaro. Now the 1968 Camaro\nwasn't entirely a copy of the 1967 version, it could be said that\nthe new 1968 Camaro was a new and improved version of the Camaro\nthat everybody already fell in love with. Upgrades in 1968 were\nhighlighted by a more modern wraparound windshield, larger door\nwindows, and \"Astro Ventilation\" replaced the 1967 Camaro's vent\nwindows. Additionally, due to new government regulations,\nrectangular marker lights were added in '68 as well. The 1968\nCamaro was also a lot more comfortable than the previous year\nthanks to upgraded suspension as well as plusher interiors. This\nparticular '68 Camaro comes to us from a southern-based collector\nwho clearly enjoyed the upgraded performance on this pony car.\nPowering this '68 Camaro is an upgraded 396 Cubic Inch V8 engine\nfed by a single 4 barrel carburetor. The 396 V8 is backed by 4\nspeed manual transmission that makes this classic pony car a super\nfun car to drive. The Chevy big block power plant sports several\nperformance upgrades including an Edelbrock Performer aluminum\nintake manifold and upgraded headers. Exhaust from the headers\nexits through the rear tailpipes via a throaty dual exhaust setup\nthat anybody can enjoy. This classic Camaro rides on a set of\nBFGoodrich Radial T/A tires mounted on Rally Wheels and accented\nwith Chevy chrome hubcaps and beauty rings. The body on this Camaro\nhas been correctly refinished in British Green Metallic paint, a\nbeautiful color seldom seen today on most restored Camaros. This\n1968 Chevrolet Camaro's interior is absolutely gorgeous! The black\nbucket seats up front and matching rear bench seat are in wonderful\ncondition and they have been correctly reupholstered, retaining the\nappearance that this Camaro sported when it rolled of the Los\nAngeles, California, production line back in the late 1960s. The\nblack upholstered door panels, padded dash, black carpeting and\nsteering wheel are all in great shape, and all appear to remain in\ntheir stock configuration as well. Instrumentation includes a 120\nMPH speedometer with integrated odometer, along with a fuel gauge\nand various indicator lights. A previous owner astutely and neatly\nmounted a Sunpro oil pressure gauge and Sunpro Temperature gauge\nunder the dash along with an 8,000 RPM Tachometer for improved\nvisibility into the Big Block found under this Camaro's hood. The\nwoodgrain-trimmed dash is finished off with climate controls, an\nashtray, glovebox, and push-button AM radio. Whether you're buying\nyour first classic car or you're adding to an existing collection\nof classic Pony cars, this 1968 Chevrolet Camaro would make an\nexcellent choice.

        "Once you make the decision to resurrect an old-school muscle car\nusing modern technology, there is a right way and several wrong\nways to do it. But, oftentimes, finding the right way means having\nto learn a few of those wrong ways first. Well, one look at this\n1969 Chevrolet Camaro Restomod LSX, and it's clear that this\nfirst-gen Pony Car was redone about as right as it gets. Fully\nrepainted in its smoke-grey exterior paint, black hockey\nstick-shaped side decals complement the aggressive lines of this\nCamaro, huge power-coated blacked-out wheels, and a subtle yet\nsuggestive cowl-induction hood that, along with the tastefully\nplaced LSX badges, suggest that this is a bit more than your\nfather's muscle car.\nInside this beautiful beast, we find a deep, dark, and inviting\ncustom TMI interior complete with plush and supportive bucket\nseats, power windows, and air conditioning. A Billet Specialties\nthree-spoke power-assisted steering wheel sits in front of a hybrid\nanalog/digital dashboard, while a Kenwood AM/FM/Aux/Bluetooth\ntouchscreen handles, among other things, soundtrack duties to keep\nthe vibe in sync with your emotions as it pumps out from the big\nkick panel speakers next to your feet.\nUnder that cowl hood, we find a clean, body-color engine bay that\nhouses a massive 427 cubic-inch LSX motor. Built with a Stage 3 cam\nand forged internals, this powerhouse is topped with PRC LS7\naluminum cylinder heads fed with electronic fuel injection and\nexhales with a set of long tube headers and, finally, out through a\nBorla dual exhaust. That massive power is routed through a Tremec\nT56 six-speed manual transmission operated by the Chevy Performance\nParts cueball shifter sitting mid-console waiting for you to start\nrowing.\nNot only is this 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Restomod LSX built to be a\nboulevard bruiser, but unlike its original setup, this car is\nconfigured to tackle the twisties with the same alacrity as the\ndragstrip. Riding on a SpeedTech front frame and suspension that\nuses a power rack and pinion, this Camaro gets a set of high-end\nViking coilovers in all four corners to help it stay glued to the\npavement. A beefed-up Ford 9-inch rear pumpkin fitted with 3.55\ngears sends power to a gorgeous set of 18-inch BBS wheels shod in\nstaggered 335/30ZR-18 rear and 245/40ZR-18 front Nitto NT555 drag\nradial tires. And when it comes time to pull the reins on all the\ngobs of power at your disposal, a set of six-piston front and\nfour-piston rear Wilwood power brakes are ready to clamp down and\nscrub off speed in no time.\nHighlights:\n*LSX Restomod\n*427 CID V8\n*LS7 Heads\n*Stage 3 Cam\n*Forged Internals\n*EFI\n*Long Tubes\n*Borla Exhaust\n*Viking Coilovers\n*Ford 9 Inch Rear\n*Four Wheel Power Disc Brakes\n*Wilwood Six Piston Front Brakes\n*18 Inch BBS Wheels\n*Power Steering\n*TMI Custom Interior\n*Upgraded Dashboard\n*Kenwood Touchscreen\n*Bluetooth\n*AC\n*Cruise\n*Full Repaint\nSo, if you've always wanted to do a restomod, but weren't sure\nwhich was the right way and which was the wrong way, don't worry,\nbecause this car is the embodiment of all the right ways.

        "1967 CHEVROLET CAMARO SS \u2013 396/4 SPEED\nAfter witnessing the runaway success of the Ford Mustang, General Motors executives swung into action to create a sporty pony car of their own, that would take on the Mustang on the sales floor, racetrack, and drag strip. By this time, sales of the revolutionary Corvair lagged amid negative press, and Chevrolet needed a new\u2014but conventional\u2014 car to fill the segment. In September of 1966, the new Camaro made its debut, and finally, GM fans had a mid-size sporty car to be proud of. Like the competition from Dearborn, the Camaro offered a wide range of engine options stretching from the economical 230 cubic inch inline six on through to the mighty 396 cubic inch big block. Like its cross-town pony car rival from Ford, the Chevrolet Camaro is one of the cornerstones of the collector car hobby, with vast aftermarket support and legions of loyal fans around the world.\nRB Collection is proud to offer this 1967 Chevrolet Camaro SS coupe. This car comes to us from a collector in Germany and it was fully restored in America in 2013. This iconic vehicle checked off quite a few boxes on the option sheet, including the SS equipment pack with louver trim in the hood, badging, and the SS hood stripe in white; 396 cubic inch V8, 4-speed manual transmission, center console, and AM radio.\nUnder the hood, the heart of the 1967 Camaro 396 is a roaring 6.5-liter V8 engine, delivering a jaw-dropping 375 horsepower (L78). Its immense power is further enhanced by a four-barrel carburetor, providing instant acceleration and an exhilarating driving experience. This engine is perfectly paired with a four-speed manual transmission, allowing drivers to take full control of the car's power and shift gears with ease.\nThe original factory Marina Blue paint looks fantastic on this car, which still presents it in outstanding condition. The body is crisp, with straight panels and consistent, factory-appropriate gaps.\nInside, one of the first things you'll notice is that every bit of factory-correct Deluxe bright blue vinyl is in pristine condition nicely matching the exterior color, and the white stripe in the Deluxe seating completes the fully coordinated and very correct package. The ribbing on the Deluxe door panels matches the texture of the low-back bucket seats, and in between them is the desirable center console with all gauges working perfectly.\nThe 1967 Chevrolet Camaro 396 is a classic muscle car that represents the epitome of power and style from the golden era of American automobiles. With its aggressive design and powerful engine, this iconic Camaro is an undeniable presence on the road and a masterpiece for any serious collection.\nAt Ruozzi Brothers Collection, fine automobiles are our passion. Our hands-on approach and personal service set us apart from the typical volume dealer. Realize your dream of driving the classic car you always wanted and join our fast-growing family of satisfied clients around the world!\nWe welcome offers and trade and can assist with worldwide shipping arrangements.

        "\u201cIt's not very often you stumble across an authentic 1970 Camaro Rally Sport Z28 especially with the original window sticker. GM only produced 8,733 Camaro Z28 models in 1970 and a very limited amount of those were Rally Sport Z28s. This car sports its original color combination of Camaro Gold with black Z28 stripes and black interior. With a factory LT-1 350/360hp V8 and 4-speed manual transmission this car rips!\u201d \u2013 Marc Schiliro\nThis authentic 1970 Chevrolet Camaro RS Z28 is the product of a show quality restoration. It has been certified by Camaro expert Jerry MacNeish of Camaro Hi-Performance on March 24th, 2016. The report and Certificate of Authenticity are included. In 1970, the second generation Camaro was introduced and only 8,733 Z28 models were produced making this a rare and very collectable model. General Motors didn't keep records but it's believed a very limited amount was built with the Rally Sport package. As the NCRS Shipping Data Report documents this example was produced on April 1st, 1970 which was at the Norwood, Ohio factory. As the original factory window sticker documents this example is equipped with the following options: (53-53) \u2013 Camaro Gold with black Z28 stripes, (711)- Black vinyl interior, (A01)- Soft-Ray tinted glass, (D35)- Sport mirrors, (G80)- 3.73 Positraction axle, (J50)- power brakes, (M21) \u2013 4-speed close-ratio manual transmission, (U14)- Special Instrumentation, (U63)- AM pushbutton radio, (U80)- rear seat speaker, (Z22)- Rally Sport equipment and (Z28)- Special Performance equipment. The original delivery dealer was Cunningham-Kelley Chevrolet located in Hartsville, Tennessee. From the information gathered this car was a southern car for over 40 years and retains its original sheet metal. Please note there is no supporting documentation to support that claim. The car was the product of a rotisserie restoration and is in show quality condition throughout. It was owned by Legendary Motor Cars in Canada and also by Jim Mattison of Pontiac Historic Services. MS CLASSIC CARS purchased the car in July of 2024 and January of 2025 is the first time it's been listed for sale. MS CLASSIC CARS invested a total of $11,293.98 in service and detail which is documented with an invoice.\nThe exterior of this car presents very nicely throughout. It appears like a vehicle that was restored recently. The body is straight and the body panel fitment is very good including the hood. As noted above, from the information gathered this was a southern car and retains all its original sheet metal. During the restoration process the body was repainted in its original color of Camaro Gold with black Z28 stripes. This seldom seen color dresses the sporty factory design perfectly. The paint was recently detailed by the team at MS CLASSIC CARS to a brilliant shine. The paint is in overall excellent condition with very little imperfections. It retains all original factory Soft-Ray tinted glass which is in very good condition with only minor scratching. The front windshield and door stainless trim appears original. The front grille, headlight bezels, front bumpers, rear window stainless trim, rear tail light bezels and rear bumper appear to have been restored or replaced. It's been outfitted with the correct style Goodyear Polyglas GT F60-15 tires that were added by MS CLASSIC CARS. Everything on the exterior such as the windshield wipers, headlights, parking lights, turn signals, brake lights and reverse lights are in working order.\nThe interior of this car is finished in its original black color which complements the exterior perfectly. It appears that everything has been restored or replaced such as the headliner, dash pad, dash woodgrain trim, gauges, steering wheel, door panels, seats and carpeting. It retains the original factory seat belts. MS CLASSIC CARS added a new console which looks beautiful. It was outfitted with the correct style matching black rubber mats. Everything in the interior is in working order such as the interior lights, gauges, clock, radio, key buzzer and heating system. The trunk compartment was restored and refinished in gray. It's equipped with a full size spare and tools.\nThe engine compartment is nicely detailed throughout with many correct parts. It retains the original trim tag. The firewall, inner fenders and radiator support were refinished in the correct shade of black. It was decorated with factory assembly marks throughout. The car is powered by a date code LT-1 350 V8 that was factory rated with 360 horsepower. As the \u201c010\u201d casted block with \u201cC210\u201d cased dates indicate this engine was built on March 21st, 1970 which is 11 days before the car was built. Although the engine was re-stamped, it's possible the engine was the original engine to the car and during the machining process the original stamp was damaged which was common. Either way it's as date code correct as you'll ever find for a re-stamped block. The engine was completely rebuilt and runs excellent. The engine is equipped with the correct stamped intake, smog, finned valve covers and correct style air cleaner. The engine breathes through manifolds and a correct style dual exhaust system with single muffler that was replaced new. The engine is coupled to a correct \u201c661\u201d case Muncie M21 4-speed manual transmission. The transmission was re-stamped with the dates of March 02, 1970. The transmission was rebuilt and shifts precisely through the gears. The power is transferred to a date code 12-bolt rear axle with 4.10 gears. The axle casting date is April 14th, 1970 which is 13 days after the car was built. The car was originally built with 3.73 positraction rear axle.\nThe undercarriage is also nicely detailed throughout with many correct parts. The original floors were restored and paint in red oxide primer. The fuel system, power steering system, suspension components and braking system has been all gone through. MS CLASSIC CARS completely redid the entire braking system as indicated on the invoice. This car runs and drives awesome!",

        "Sleek, mean, bold, and distinct...this 1969 Chevrolet Camaro SS 396\ntribute arguably has the best of everything. So no matter if you\nlove the color combo or how the four-speed gives you total control\nof the big block, this coupe delivers fun and upgraded\nexperience.\nThe bold paint reminds us of GM's ultra-desirable Daytona Yellow.\nIt's an upgrade later in life that gives you plenty of gloss and\nradiance without becoming a museum piece. We also love the yellow\nbecause it showcases the dark contrasting features of the SS\nupgrades, like the blackout grille, deep chin spoiler, and blackout\nrear panels that tell Camaro fans a big block is under the hood.\nSome of these dark upgrades are extra thoughtful. The side stripe\nwas cleared over for a smooth and permanent appearance. And those\nmag-style wheels are modern American Racing alloys. The lowered\nstance, SS-style vent trim hood, and rear spoiler complete the look\nof a powerful classic. But you can tell there's some added quality\nhere, too. It's in the little things like the shine of the bumpers\nand the way the doors close smoothly.\nThe full black interior gives you more of that attractive style\nagainst the exterior's yellow. It's clean and complete, including a\nterrific-looking center console with wood-like trim. You'll even\nappreciate little details, like the button-top seatbacks, front\nheadrests, and working dome light. But the best part is how you get\na proper driver's car feeling. It's in the smooth grip of the\nwood-rimmed sports steering wheel. It's how the auxiliary readouts\ngive you essential info. And the tingle you get when it feels like\nthe Hurst shifter was made just for your hand.\nThe fenders advertise a big block, and all that motor under the\nhood proves it wasn't lying. Like the rest of this coupe, it was\nmade to be seen with the bold orange block, shining valve covers,\nand bright air grabber. The upgraded 396/402 cubic-inch V8 inhales\ndeeply with a Holley four-barrel carburetor and Edelbrock intake.\nAnd the Flowmasters on the dual exhaust give it a terrific tune.\nYou take full control of this big block power and rumbling\nsoundtrack with the Muncie M20 four-speed manual transmission. It's\nan all-around solid driver with power steering, power brakes, front\ndiscs, and wide BF Goodrich, T/As.\nThis Camaro loves to turn heads with everything from its color to\nits rumble. So it makes for the bold car that loves to hit the\nstreets as much as you do. So if you're ready for all eyes on you,\ndon't miss this coupe. Call now!",
        "This 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 has been meticulously restored over\na 20-year ownership period. Finished in eye-catching Daytona Yellow\nwith bold black stripes, this Camaro's paint gleams with a fresh,\nslick finish applied in 2020. The iconic Z28 styling cues are all\npresent - front and rear spoilers, Rally wheels, and aggressive\nstance. Rolling on 15-inch Rally wheels wrapped in 235/60R15 tires,\nthis Camaro's road presence is undeniable. New bumpers and trim\npieces complete the showroom-fresh exterior.\nInside, the cabin showcases a blend of classic style and modern\ncomfort. Black leather and cloth bucket seats with houndstooth\ninserts provide a performance-oriented feel. The dash houses crisp\naftermarket gauges, while Vintage Air controls are cleanly\nintegrated. A sleek console shifter for the 4-speed manual\ntransmission takes center stage. The headliner and all trim pieces\nappear fresh from the factory floor. Notably, this Z28 forgoes a\nradio, focusing instead on the pure driving experience.\nPowering this Camaro is a ZZ6 350 CI V8 crate engine, a modern\npowerhouse that brings reliable muscle to this classic. It's paired\nwith a 4-speed manual transmission, delivering an engaging driving\nexperience. The engine bay is a showcase of performance upgrades:\naluminum heads, a high-rise GM intake topped with a Holley\ncarburetor, and an electronic ignition system. Long tube headers\nfeed into a FlowMaster dual exhaust system, producing a throaty\ngrowl. An aluminum radiator with an electric fan keeps things cool,\nwhile a serpentine belt system adds reliability.

        "Awesome 1968 Camaro SS396. Freshly built MQ-code L78 396/375\nhorsepower with 4-speed. Beautiful and unusual Sequoia Green paint.\nDetailed undercarriage, new interior. Nicely documented. A cool big\nblock Camaro with a lot of power behind it.Some of our favorite\ncars are those that combine a subtle look with big firepower under\nthe hood, and this pretty 1968 Chevrolet Camaro SS396 is no\nexception. In photos, the paint looks charcoal gray, but there's\ndefinitely a hint of green to it?hence the name 'Sequoia Green.'\nIt's unusual but correct as code V is this car's original color.\nUnderneath, there's some very straight bodywork that shows rather\nwell, and as an early production '68, it has the nose stripe that\nblends into the side spear for a unique look that'll definitely\nstand out. Panel gaps are quite good all around and we're happy to\nsee that the car wears an original-style hood with the simulated\nchrome velocity stacks?still one of the cooler designs of the era.\nWe believe the quarters have been replaced but the work was\nexpertly done and the car fits together beautifully with no signs\nof hack work or amateur patching. Correct badges were fitted\nwherever they were needed, and we love the industrial look of a\nCamaro without the ubiquitous ducktail spoiler. This one just looks\nmean and purposeful. And as a bonus, all the lighting is\nLED?nice!Inside, most of the interior furnishings are new,\nincluding the seat covers, carpets, and door panels. There's a\nwoodgrained steering wheel that warms up the otherwise all-black\ndriver's compartment, and enthusiasts will be pleased to see\noptions like a tilt steering column, a factory tick-tock-tach, and\nauxiliary gauges down on the center console. There's also a Hurst\nshifter with cue ball knob for the Muncie 4-speed underneath, and\nit racks through the gears like a bolt-action rifle. There's also a\nfresh A/C and heater system from Vintage Air that uses R134a\nrefrigerant for easy maintenance in the future (note that the\noriginal heater components are included). There's also a digital\nAM/FM stereo with speakers in the custom kick panels that provide a\nneatly integrated look. The car is equipped with unusual factory\nshoulder belts, which were a rare option in 1968, and it appears\nthat most of the weather seals were replaced during the build so it\nseals up well. In back there's a super clean trunk with correct\nspatter paint and a new mat to make it look tidy.The engine is a\ncorrect MQ-coded 396 cubic inch V8, and the MQ suffix code decodes\nto a 1968 L78 with 375 horsepower and a 4-speed manual\ntransmission. With a fresh rebuild by the experts at Mongoose\nMotorsports (receipts accompany the car), it probably grunts out at\nleast that much today. A few modifications help, including an\nEdelbrock aluminum intake manifold, a set of beautiful long-tube\nheaders, and a big 4-barrel carburetor on top. It wears correct\nChevy Orange paint and proper 375 horsepower decals so it looks the\npart of a Camaro powerplant. Other upgrades include a dual power\nmaster cylinder for the front disc brakes, a large aluminum\nradiator, a polished A/C compressor, and a new alternator.\nUnderneath, it's quite clean with super solid floors, subframe\nconnectors, and all-new lines for fuel and brakes. The Muncie\n4-speed feeds a 12-bolt rear end with what we believe are 3.42\ngears inside, which are a nice combination of acceleration and easy\ncruising on the highway. You'll also find new shocks, a fresh gas\ntank out back, and a rumbling dual exhaust system with stainless\nMagnaflow mufflers. And it gets just the right industrial look from\n15-inch steel wheels painted body color and outfitted with dog dish\nhubcaps and 225/70/15 BFGoodrich T/A radials.Documentation includes\nextensive receipts for the recent work, including the engine\nrebuild, as well as photos and details from previous owners. We\nhaven't seen many early Camaros that combine great looks, lots of\ncomfort and convenience features, and a bulletproof big block\npowertrain. The awesome color combination is insanely appealing and\nit more than lives up to the billing with the built 396 under the\nhood. A Camaro that's a whole lot of fun to drive and show, ready\nto rock.

        "1970 Chevrolet Camaro \"Dick Brown\" Trans Am For Sale- Campaigned In\nThe 1971 & 1972 Trans Am Season LMC is very proud to offer for sale\nthis 1970 Chevrolet Camaro Dick Brown Trans Am Race Car The\nsecond-gen Chevrolet Camaro was introduced in the spring of 1970,\nfour years after General Motors had brought their pony car to\nmarket. The all new second-gen Camaro was a significant departure\nfrom its predecessor, being longer, wider, and lower than the first\ngen. These changes lend themselves well to the new Camaro becoming\na dominant race car in the Trans Am Series. The year 1970 is\nconsidered by many as the zenith for Trans-Am racing with\nfactory-backed entries from Ford, Chevrolet, AMC, Pontiac,\nPlymouth, and Dodge. The series attracted the best racing teams and\ndrivers such as Penske Racing/Mark Donohue, Bud Moore\nEngineering/Parnelli Jones, Chaparral Racing/Jim Hall, AAR/Dan\nGurney and Autodynamics/Sam Posey. This 1970 Chevrolet Camaro Z28\nwas initially purchased by Don Duncan from Nurse Chevrolet in\nToronto, Canada. Don had traded his 1968 Corvette for this Camaro\nwith the intention of having it prepared for racing in Trans Am. He\nhad enlisted John Todds of TODCO Racing to build his Z28 into an\nSCCA Trans-Am legal race car. Now with a fully raced prepared car,\nthey needed a competitive driver that could bring home some\nsilverware. Canadian race car driver Dick Brown had been looking\nfor a ride for the 1971 Trans Am season but had a hard time\nconvincing local Canadian sponsors to invest in an American based\nTrans Am series. Prior to the 1971 Trans-Am season, had been trying\nto find the funds together to get a seat in a Bud Moore Engineering\nMustang. He needed to raise to $75,000 to race a Bud Moore Mustang\nas the #2 team car to Parnelli Jones. Unfortunately, in the end he\ncame up short by about $25,000.00. Dick then got a call from John\nTodds who asked him to drive this Camaro in the 1971 season. Dick\nagreed and this Camaro was raced in the 1971 Trans-Am series as a\nTodco Racing entry. The 1971 season proved to be tough as the car\nincurred many technical difficulties resulting in multiple DNFs. ,\nFor 1972, the car received a fresh new look painted Sunoco Blue and\nran under the banner of Sunoco of Canada, Gagnon Spring, and Duncan\nChevrolet. During the 1972 SCCA Trans-Am season, this car had much\nbetter success than the year prior. In the four SCCA Trans-Am\nevents contested, this car's best finishes were an impressive 5th\nplace finish at the Road America Trans-Am, and a 6th place at\nWatkins Glen. Dick Brown also won the Mayor's Cup Race at the 1972\nMolson Grand Prix/Trois Rivieres weekend in this car. Documenting\nthis special Trans Am racer, is binders full of newspaper articles,\nperiod photographs, SVRA logbook, SVRA brass tag, service receipts,\nownership history and much more. Don't miss this opportunity to\nacquire a Trans Am series racer with historical provenance that is\nimmediately eligible for vintage racing including the prestigious\nMonterey Historics. This Historic Trans Am eligible car is a true\nfront runner, as it raced in period with Porsche 917 brakes and a\nfully lightened body. A unique opportunity to purchase a very\nspecial historically significant piece of Tran Am history.\nAdditional Details: 1970 CHEVROLET CAMARO -",

        "Welcome to Street Dreams as we celebrate our 26th year in the\nclassic and muscle car business. Chevrolet's Camaro has been an\nunqualified success since it burst onto the automotive stage in\n1967, due in large part to its amazing versatility. Whether you\nwanted an economical commuter, a comfy cruiser, or a stoplight\nstormer, the Camaro offered something for everyone. Developed as a\ncompetitor for Ford's Mustang, these pony cars would maintain a\nfierce rivalry that continues to this day. This wicked 1969 Camaro\nConvertible definitely leans toward the stoplight stormer type, but\nit does so with vastly increased performance and safety. Lift the\nfunctional steel super scoop hood and you'll be greeted by a\nferocious GMPP 502 V8 that's sporting forged internals, a hydraulic\nroller cam, a Holley carburetor, a GMPP aluminum intake manifold,\naluminum heads, and a Mallory billet distributor. Additional\nfeatures include a tubular steel front subframe with coilovers and\npower rack and pinion steering, power 4-wheel disc brakes, 5-speed\nmanual transmission with HD scatter shield, 4-link rear end with\ncoilovers, front and rear stabilizer bars, tubular steel subframe\nconnectors, custom interior, tilt steering column with custom\nwheel, console with gauges, an Alpine AM/FM/CD audio system, and\nBillet Specialties alloy wheels wearing aggressive rubber\n(245/45ZR17 F, 275/40ZR18 R). This beast takes the Camaro nickname\nthe Hugger, as in road hugger, seriously and one look at the\nchassis in the images provided explains why. This is, by far, the\nbest handling Camaro Convertible I've driven, and I've driven many.\nOne more top-shelf classic with blistering performance from the\nteam that can make your dream a reality.

        "Celebrating our 65 year anniversary! This family owned and operated\nbusiness was established in 1960, making us the oldest classic car\ndealership in America. Special thank you to all our customers for\nentrusting us to park the car of your dreams in your driveway while\npreserving automotive history for future generations to embrace and\nenjoy.\n-Grams family & Volo Museum staff\nIntroduction: Beauty and a beast! This '68 Yenko Camaro tribute\nreceived a stunning frame off restoration. You don't see a 68\nYenko, it stands apart from the others. A new ZZ502 Crate engine\nelevates it to the next level. Additionally custom TMI buckets,\ncustom gauges and a top quality paint job provide unprecedented\nstyle and comfort. Fresh with only 1,230 miles since completion. We\nacquired this from a fussy collector. I look forward to his phone\ncall with something for sale! Any angle you look at her from, she\nis pretty and powerful and ready to hit the streets!\nEXTERIOR: Exceptional body and paint work! The Cortez Silver paint\nhas just the right amount of flake to make it shimmer and is laid\nout perfectly. It's seriously polished like a piece of glass, so\nsmooth and slick. The black stripe is properly done to factory\ndimensions. Looking down the side of the arrow straight body is\nsatisfying thanks to the smooth contours and crisp lines. The\npanels are very nicely aligned with gaps that are well above\naverage. The spoilers and hood scoop really enhance the profile.\nEverything up front looks spotless, it even has correct T3\nheadlights. Yenko badges pay homage to the original. The windshield\nand rear window are new. The rubber seals and fuzzy strips were\neven replaced. The bumpers and remaining trim pieces all have a\nglorious shine. It's equipped with dual side mirrors and the door\nledge moldings too. It has the ideal stance and is rolling on 15\"\nRally II Wheels which is what Yenko used in 1968. They even have\nYenko center caps and new polished rings. They are wrapped in a set\nof reproduction BFG radial redline tires.\nINTERIOR: Completely refinished top to bottom using mostly brand\nnew parts! It is upgraded with digital/analog gauges from Dakota\nDigital and reclining sport buckets by TMI. The seats are very\ncomfortable and trimmed like the original with modern touches. The\nheadliner, dash pad, steering column, steering wheel, door panels,\nhandles, levers, visors, mirror, gauge bezel, center console,\nshifter, glove box liner, rear shelf and carpeting are all new. It\nalso has a new retro looking stereo that fits in the factory hole\nand a Kicker 4x10 dash speaker plus 6x9s in the back.\nENGINE COMPARTMENT: GM Crate ZZ502 making 502hp and 580 lbs of\ntorque! Enjoy all that brute power knowing it has the ultimate in\nreliability. We have the paperwork on this engine, it was purchased\nnew 11-23 and only 1,230 miles have been put on it. It comes with\naluminum heads and intake and an HEI ignition. A new dual feed\nHolley carb and a set of coated Doug's headers were installed. It\nfeatures a few upgrades including hydroboost power steering and a\npower brake system. It also has a new radiator and clutch fan.\nUpgraded DSE wiper system. A Delco battery topper and reproduction\nspring clamp cables add a nice vintage look. The underside of the\nfiberglass hood, fenderwells and firewall are all neatly painted\nsatin black.\nTRUNK COMPARTMENT: The underside of the trunk lid and jamb are\nnicely painted like the exterior. It has reproduction stickers and\nthe weatherstrip was replaced. Inside is all rust free and solid\nmetal with a coating of black paint and a new rubber mat. It also\nhas a new tire and painted rim for a spare tire and the jack\nassembly.\nUNDERSIDE: Very nice! The steering was rebuilt and works great.\nSprings and shocks were replaced up front plus it has a swaybar.\nThe leaf springs out back also look fresh and have new hardware\ntoo. The brakes have been completely rebuilt and even the emergency\nbrake is hooked up, they are disc upfront. Long tube headers and a\nstainless Flowmaster exhaust system have this monster sounding\nmean. The gas tank and all the lines were replaced. Looking up at\nthe motor it has a Milodon extra capacity oil pan. The flywheel\ncover, trans pan and rear end cover are a matched set; a very cool\nlooking finned aluminum painted black with polished find. The Turbo\n400 automatic trans was serviced, a new torque converter was\ninstalled. It also has a 12 bolt rear end with new 3.42 posi gears.\nThe floors are solid and rust free with neatly applied black\npaint.\nSERVICE: Our shop manager thoroughly inspected this car and we\nreplaced the center console, shifter and trim rings on the wheels.\nWe also lubed the left rear window, adjusted the exhaust and\nbalanced the wheels.\nThis killer machine with a raging 502 V8 has got what it takes to\nbe the boss! The looks are killer too. If you're in the market for\na Camaro that was built to be driven without regret, buying one of\nfussy Joe's cars is what you want.

        "When it debuted in 1970, the second generation of Chevy's Camaro\nbecame a low-slung swoopy speedster that looked like a European\nexotic from almost any angle. To prove that point, take one look at\nthis head-turning 1971 Chevrolet Camaro SS Tribute decked out in a\nfully repainted orange and black theme with complementary black\ndecal accents on the front fenders . Sporting a unique combination\nof Rally Sport front bumpers to go along with its strategically\nplaced Super Sport badges, this F-body is one of a kind.\nInside, the stock-appearing correct vinyl interior has been changed\nfrom its original Dark Jade to Jet Black, giving this Camaro a\nslick and sinister feel from behind the padded four-spoke steering\nwheel. Just beyond that wheel sits a seven-pod gauge cluster, while\nan additional trio of auxiliary gauges is situated at the base of\nthe console just beyond the staple-style gear selector. An\naftermarket FM radio with an aux input uses front center and rear\ndeck-mounted speakers to seamlessly blend a bit of modern tech\nwithout disrupting the retro vibes of this muscle Car.\nUnder the aggressive cowl-induction hood, we find a 400 cubic-inch\nsmall-block V-8 topped with an Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor and\nmatching Edelbrock intake manifold. A set of long tube headers\nfeeds into a true dual exhaust, while a set of performance mufflers\nadd a throaty growl that gives this muscle car the perfect tone to\nmatch its ferociously confident exterior. Power is routed through a\nTH350 three-speed automatic transmission before reaching a ten-bolt\nrear.

The\n1967 Camaro was more than just Chevrolet's answer to the 1st\nGeneration Ford Mustangs, it was the beginning of Chevrolets\ndominance in the segment. Derived from a French word meaning\n\"Comrade\" or \"Friend\", the Camaro was quickly recognized as a\nfriendly word for sports car buyers looking for a true value. The\n1st generation Camaro has always delivered performance in a\nwonderful package, and this 1967 Chevrolet Camaro RS/SS 350\ncontinues that storied tradition! This '67 is as original as it\ngets with Factory A/C (not blowing cold), factory power steering,\nfactory 350CID V-8 and the factory 4 Speed manual. The Red standard\nbuckets (741,Z) split down the middle with the center console along\nwith the red headliner, door panels, dash pad and carpet contrast\nnicely against the Tuxedo Black paint job with the white sport\nstripe on the nose. One look at the list of factory options on this\ntrim tag shows just how special & highly-collectible this RS/SS\nreally is. The deluxe three-spoke steering wheel frames a 120-mph\nspeedometer and a 7k-rpm tachometer. Auxiliary gauges for fuel\nlevel, engine temperature, oil pressure and battery charge are\nlocated on the center stack ahead of the shifter. This 1967 Camaro\nRS/SS is undeniably a true American classic! Cars of this caliber\nare becoming harder and harder to find, and now is the opportunity\nto be one of a select few to own a true piece of American\nautomotive history.",

Transmission\n\u2022 Modern Transmission: The original 1969 Yenko Camaro would have\ncome with a Muncie 4-speed manual or automatic transmission, but in\nthe LSA recreation, it is mated to a 4L80E automatic, ensuring\nsmooth power delivery and improved performance.\n4.

Jim is legendary in the Camaro world. It then went on to its next owner a muscle car dealer in Washington DC who used the car as his daily driver. Tony had the car for several years but the high revs in DC traffic had him send the car to Muscle car expert Scott Tieman of Supercar Specialties in Portland MI. Scott tamed the beast for Tony who enjoyed the car for several more years before enlisting RK Motors to consign the car for him. In 2007 the car found a new owner in Spain.

        "Wow! These colors on a '69 Camaro with RS-SS features is a very\ndesirable find. Well, it doesn't stop there, it's a convertible\nwith a 4-speed too. I sold this car 24 years ago! We have pictures\nand a stack of receipts documenting the professional build. A\nsignificant amount of restoration was done from new paint to a GM\ncrate engine. Less than 3,000 miles have been put on since\ncompletion. What a knockout!\nEXTERIOR: This color combo is to die for! The Hockey stick stripe\nis painted on and plays perfectly off the interior. The body was\nmedia blasted and professionally restored. When looking down the\nside it is 100% straight as an arrow. All the panels are flush and\nsquare with correct alignment and consistent gaps that are well\nabove average. The doors close easily with minimal effort. The\npaint was neatly laid out and has a mirror like finish. The white\nvinyl top is in great shape and it comes with the correct white\nboot as well. The chrome all looks nice and has a lustrous shine. A\n$1,100 LED exterior light kit was recently installed. The front\ngrille and hideaway headlights are in great condition. The optional\nspoilers and cowl induction hood really enhance the profile. It's\nsitting on 15\" Rally wheels with a polished lip and SS Spinner\ncenter caps that are wrapped in BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires.\nINTERIOR: Awesome! Very nice and clean, functional interior that's\nthe perfect blend of original and refurbished pieces. The springs\nand cushions for all the seats have been redone and the upholstery\nwas replaced too. The Hurst 4 speed manual shifter proudly sits\nfront and center. Water temp and oil pressure gauges were added\nunder the dash. Seatbelts front and back, so you can cruise with\nthe entire family. There is a modern stereo concealed in the glove\nbox, and the 6x9 speakers can easily be removed if you need the\nextra space. All the interior lights are also working.\nENGINE COMPARTMENT: This 350-330 hp GM crate engine offers the\nultimate in reliability and is ready to cruise. 2 taps on the gas,\nthen a tap of the key and you are ready to go. The functional cowl\ninduction hood forces air into the engine, and long tube headers\nlet the air flow out. It is topped off with a Holley Demon carb and\nEdelbrock intake manifold, it is also equipped with power brakes.\nAll the hoses, wires and belts were replaced. The Optima red top\ngel battery is properly secured and also has a master cut off. The\nhorns are hooked up and the original trim tag is still in place.\nThe underside of the hood is painted just like the body and the\nremaining metal was all neatly painted satin black.\nTRUNK COMPARTMENT: The underside of the trunk lid and jamb are\npainted slick just like the body. The weatherstrip was replaced.\nInside is all solid and rust free metal with a neatly applied\nspatter finish paint. It's equipped with a space saver spare, jack\nassembly, lug wrench and rubber mat.\nUNDERSIDE: The invoices show that the front end was rebuilt and\ndisc brakes were installed in front. All 4 shocks have been\nreplaced. The floor pans have also been replaced. Just recently the\nfuel tank, sending unit and straps were replaced. The exhaust looks\nlike it's new also. Looking up at the engine it's still very clean\nand has a high torque starter. There's also an invoice for\nrebuilding the M-20 Muncie 4 speed manual transmission, so that\nlooks fresh too.\nSERVICE: We inspected the car and repaired a stiff throttle pedal,\nreplaced loose shift knob, installed a reverse light switch,\nrepaired window molding, installed door bumpers, repaired the top,\nand reworked the e-brake release.\nIf you want to look cool while having a ton of fun and not drain\nthe 401K, this drop top Camaro is perfect for you! The turnkey\ncrate 350 engine should provide years of thought free cruising\npleasure, and the tuxedo color combination will turn heads\neverywhere you go. This professional build was done totally\nright!\nFor nearly 30 years, I, Jay Grams, have personally written the\nhighlights for almost every car in our collection.

        "1972 Chevrolet Camaro Hardtop\nDrag racing was born in the dry lake beds in the California\ndeserts. In the 1930s as engines got better and drivers got braver,\nspeeds began topping 100mph. But it wasn't until after World War II\nthat a bunch of kids with cars, hanging out with nowhere in\nparticular to go, turned into something more serious. Popularity\ngrew steadily but drag racing still remained largely an underground\npastime. Races frequently took place on disused military runways\nwith the first organized event dating back to 1949 at the Goleta\nAir Base in California. As the decade turned drag racing began to\nget organized. The National Hot Rod Association, (NHRA), was\nfounded in 1951 by Wally Parks, and within the decade two classes\nof competition had developed 'Unmodified Stock' and 'Top\nEliminator'.\nFor consignment a 1972 Camaro, highly modified to get the lowest ET\npossible in a straight line race. Plenty of power, a mostly\noriginal looking 1972 car, but do not be fooled, this Camaro rocks\nand knocks off socks. Sporting a worked to the nines 660+hp 496ci\nV8, a Ford 9\" axle and 6,260 non verifiable miles on the updated\ninstrument cluster. This Camaro is ready, willing and able to hand\nout an ass kicking at the drop of a hat...or arm for that\nmatter.\nExterior\nWith a Dark Blue Metallic respray on this street legal straight\nliner has plenty of spit shine left on the steel. Exterior gaps are\ngood, and panels remain straight but the paint does show with a few\nchips and battle scars on the lowers of the body. A large rear\nfacing hood scoop allows for plenty of nostrils for the inhale and\nthe power plant just under. Chrome hood pins lead the way at the\nfront of the hood which has taken on a somewhat Trans Am look with\na V front grille, single headlights and round parking/signal\nlighting just next to the grille. Front split bumpers are\nmirror-like, and all trim remains very nicely preserved. Starting\nin 1970, began the years when GM began to change the design of the\nCamaro, and blurred the lines between a Camaro and a Pontiac, give\na gaze to the front of the car and it will pan out! Not a true\n\"beak\" but certainly features that resemble each other. 15-inch\npolished Weld DragLite wheels are wrapped with 215/65/R15's in\nfront, and with 275/60R15 on the rear. Bringing up the rear of the\ncar is a small spoiler, another shiny chrome bumper and the round\ntail lighting.\nInterior\nA swing of the doors and we see some slight modification to the\ninterior, starting with a full 6-point roll cage, correct Camaro\nblack vinyl bucket seats with 4-point harnesses, and some Autometer\ngauges to replace the factory ones, all mounted within a carbon\nfiber bezel in the stock black dash. Plenty of toggles to play with\nin the center and nice black carpet covers the floors. Other\nhighlights include a Hurst shifter in the power window toggle\nequipped console, Grant rally steering wheel, and an interesting\ncombo of street racer and creature comforts. All this sits between\noriginal door panels right out of 1972 that have been fitted with\npolished aluminum lower sections. A shout to the trunk where the\nfuel cell and battery now resides.\nDrivetrain\nA pristine and highly polished huge 496ci Chevrolet V8 is stuffed\nunder the hood. This money shot marvel of racing engineering\ncontaina Callies forged crank, Crower forged rods, and a Comp Cams\n.710i/.680eroller cam which uses roller lifters. It sports Brodix\naluminum heads with Jesel 1.7 roller rockers, and a Brodix intake.\nFossils flow freely through a single Holley 4-barrel carburetor.\nStrapped to the back is a 3-speed TH400 automatic which has an ATI\n8\" stall converter, a reverse manual valve body and a trans brake.\nThe rear axle is a hefty Ford 9\" unit with Richmond gears, and a\nMarkWilliams spool and Mark Williams axles. I assure you kids, we\nare NOT screwing around with this powerhouse!\nUndercarriage\nIndependent coil springs featuring tubular front control arms, and\nfor the rear, leaf springs with Cal Track bars. All disc brakes for\nthis racer and for the exhale we have headers which flow into a\nMagnaflow exhaust. Breathe deep, now exhale! Woosh...\nDrive-Ability\nYes! Yes! Yes! It definitely drives, it certainly starts, and it\noffers up plenty of ear candy when the throttle is pushed. Climbing\nin is a bit much for this old writer, but once in it is\ncomfortable, and all is working well. Definitely an all polished\nlike a shiny apple, eager to give a teaching lesson to a lesser\nvehicle who dares to step up to the line. While Classic Auto Mall\nrepresents that these functions were working at the time of our\ntest drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at\nthe time of your purchase.\nAt first glance an original 1972 style Camaro with some interesting\nwheels and a big rear facing scooped hood. But if we dig deeper,\nthere is plenty of extra blood, sweat and tears that went into this\ncar on the mechanical front, and if remotely interested, you should\nhave a gander at the specs, which are well documented.

        "There is something special about owning a first-generation Pony\nCar. The spirit of open-road exuberance that can only be provided\nby a small block V-8 is like no other feeling. One look at this\ngorgeous Red Metallic 1968 Chevrolet Camaro, and it's easy to see\nits allure. Whether it is the dual full-length black racing\nstripes, matching black vinyl top, cowl induction hood, or classic\nChevy Rallye wheels that you notice first, this car personifies the\ntrue muscle car ethos.\nWe find a set of black vinyl bucket seats separated by a helpful\ncenter console. A four-spoke power-assisted steering wheel sits\nbefore the big speedometer/tachometer tandem. At the same time, a\nthree-pod gauge cluster at the bottom of the center dash stack adds\noil pressure, battery volts, and water pressure readings to the\nmix. Three sliding HVAC controls offer ease of use we could only\ndream of today, and while there may not be a radio at the moment,\nall it takes is a blip of the throttle to give you all the aural\nexcitement you could want.\nUnder that cowl hood sits a modified bored-and-stroked 406 cubic\ninch V-8 featuring aluminum heads, a single four-barrel Holley\ndouble-pumper carburetor, Holley aluminum intake, long tube\nheaders, and a sweet-sounding MagnaFlow exhaust that can flex\nanytime you want this muscle car to show off a little bit. That\npower is channeled through a TH400 three-speed automatic\ntransmission before reaching the rear wheels via the 12-bolt rear\nend. Shod in wide 275/70R-15 rear and staggered 215/60R-15 BFG\nrubber, this Camaro's 15-inch Rallye wheels complete the aggressive\nlook this car was made to exude.\nAlthough it rides on its factory-style suspension, this 1968\nChevrolet Camaro has been beefed up with a trick set of subframe\nconnectors to give it more rigidity running through those tight\ncorners. Front disc brakes (with rear drums) help scrub speed off\nwhenever the need to rein in this pony arises.\nHighlights:\n*406 CID Stroker V8\n*Aluminum Heads\n*Holley Double Pumper\n*Holley Aluminum Intake\n*Long tube headers\n*MagnaFlow Exhaust\n*Cowl hood\n*TH400 Three Speed Auto\n*Subframe Connectors\n*Front Disc Brakes\n*Power Steering\nFew cars offer the feeling that a first-generation muscle car does,\nand if you've never experienced that thrill for yourself, don't\nwait a minute longer.

The car\nhas all its original solid and rust free floor boards and and the\ncondition of the interior, trim and glass is all excellent. This\nengine is extremely strong and responsive with excellent oil\npressure and no noticeable oil leaks and which sounds absolutely\nmagnificent, the transmission shifts smoothly through the gears and\nthe engine temperature always remains cool. The massive success\nthat was Fords Mustang did not go unnoticed by the folks over at\nChevrolet. Looking to capture a share of the burgeoning pony car\nmarket, Chevrolets answer to the Mustang was the Camaro. Making its\ndebut in September of 1966 the Camaro, like the Mustang, was\navailable in a wide array of options and body styles. Introduced\ntwo years after the Mustang, Chevrolet realized that to pose a\nserious threat, merely introducing the Camaro would not be enough -\na car capable of beating the Mustang at the racetrack was needed if\nthe Camaro was to stand a chance against the widely popular Mustang\nand thus the Z28 was born.This is one very fine daily driving\nexample of an increasingly collectible and desirable 1968 Chevrolet\nCamaro Convertible in unabused and mostly all original and stock\ngood condition; these are very rare American classic cars and will\nalways be internationally respected and desired by any classic\nAmerican classic car or Camaro enthusiast!

        "HIGHLIGHTS: 383V8 hooked up to a 5-speed manual transmission! Detroit Speed goodies!

Professionally wrapped in matte black film, any imperfections would become immediately obvious. The body lines are crisp and sharp, and this Camaro is bound to turn some heads! The carbon fiber trunk spoiler adds to that classic \"muscle car\" look, while contributing to this Camaro's absolutely menacing demeanor.

With all modifications performed in the last few years, it's no surprise what good condition everything is in!\nINTERIOR CONDITION OVERVIEW: Step inside the Camaro, and suddenly it feels as if it is 1968 again-for a moment. The tasteful aftermarket steering wheel leads your eyes to the Phantom gauge overlays. A glance to the floor will show a shifter for the 5-speed manual transmission. The interior is in nice condition, with original style black vinyl and cloth houndstooth seat material. The modern radio in the dash works at should, and powers an impressive but not overpowering sound system ideal for miles of comfortable cruising.\nMECHANICAL OVERVIEW: Under the hood sits a 383 V8 pushing just under 343hp to the rear wheels. When accounting for drivetrain loss, one can assume that the engine is somewhere in the 400hp-450hp range. The mechanics of this car are truly the bite to its bark! The exhaust is sure to perk up some ears when cruising around town, and the performance of this car certainly backs up that slick, menacing exterior look. You won't believe how well this car handles! Outfitted with a variety of high-quality Detroit Speed suspension components, this Camaro is smooth, tight, and goes where you point it.\nWHAT YOU'LL LOVE ABOUT THIS CAR: This Camaro has a subtle but unique look.

The sound, the\nfeeling of the idle, and the relentless surge of torque as you\npower through the gears. Even back in the day these were legitimate\n12-second cars, and even today's world of 600 horsepower Corvettes,\nperformance is impressive.

        "Following the tremendous success of the Ford Mustang, executives at\nGeneral Motors moved quickly to develop their own sporty pony car\nto rival the Mustang on the sales floor, racetrack, and drag strip.\nAt that point, the innovative Corvair was struggling with declining\nsales due to negative publicity, prompting Chevrolet to introduce a\nnew yet conventional car to fill that market segment. The 1967\nCamaro made its debut in September, giving GM enthusiasts a\nmid-size sporty vehicle to take pride in. Similar to the\ncompetition from Dearborn, the Camaro boasted a variety of engine\noptions, ranging from the economical 230 cubic inch inline six to\nthe formidable 396 cubic inch big block.

        "1967 Chevrolet Camaro RS/SS Hardtop Tribute\nRS on a Camaro speak stands for Rally Sport which was a cosmetic\npackage available on all trim levels. It included hidden\nheadlights, and reverse lights below the bumper, as well as a few\nother options. When matched with the SS performance package, you\nhad a mean looking Camaro that could perform as well as it\nlooked.\nFor consignment, a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro sport coupe dressed up as\nan RS/SS showing 18,003 non-verifiable miles on the odometer. While\na \"clone\" would have the correct engine and other mechanical and\ncosmetic mimicry, a \"tribute\" takes certain parts and gives a\nproverbial nod to that model. That's not to say our car has not had\nsome tasteful upgrades and along with RS components, represents a\ngreat car for your consideration. The engine, transmission and rear\nwere rebuilt 2,000 miles ago according to our consignor and a new\nwiring harness is on board to distribute the amps.\nExterior\nTwo stage Bolero Red paint is complemented by a black SS nose\nstripe with SS emblems filling the break in the stripe. An SS\nemblem is also on the grille which is flanked by matching headlight\ncovers in true RS fashion. The cowl hood extends high over the\nvents, held in place by locking hood pins, and the windshield leads\nto a black vinyl top in excellent condition. The chrome bumpers and\nmetalwork are in great condition and so is the SS gas cap on back\nunder a racy rear spoiler. 15-inch Chevrolet Rally wheels are on\nboard here with staggered size tires that contribute to the raked\nstance of the car. A tasteful black pinstripe ends on the door with\na black bowtie and a 327 crest is on the front quarter panel.\nOverall, the paint and exterior condition is in great condition,\nand we could not find any glaring exterior flaws.\nInterior\nSimple black door cards welcome occupants of the car with typical\nfeatures and Camaro plaques on each door. Black vinyl buckets seats\nare in very good condition and the back seats are equally as nice.\nA black padded steering wheel rim surrounds four plastic spokes,\nand the column provides the mounting base for a tachometer and oil\npressure light. Twin coves house the speedometer on the left while\nblack plastic backs the center stack that houses the vent controls\nand AM/FM/Cassette radio and a triplet gauge pod is mounted under\nthe dash. A Hurst shifter with a chrome ball handle serves as the\njoystick and like the entire center console, is in great shape.\nBlack loop style carpet covers the floor along with vintage style\nCamaro rubber mats, while a stitched black headliner is clean and\nintact.\nDrivetrain\nJust as the fenders say, a rebuilt 327ci power plant sits proudly\nand in the very clean engine bay. Fuel is brought in by a 4-barrel\ncarburetor and a Muncie M20 4-speed manual transmission sends power\nto the rear wheels where the 10 bolt axle is found. The engine bay\nis replete with polished metal and coated headers, while red\nignition wires add some color and match the block. A gold brake\nbooster assists with sending fluid to power disc brakes in the\nfront with drilled and slotted rotors and power drums in the\nrear.\nUndercarriage\nVery clean and dry underneath, uniformly black and only hints of\nminimal surface rust. The dual exhaust comes from the headers and\nlinks to an H-pipe before meeting up with a pair of Flowmaster\nmufflers and exhaust, finally dumping inconspicuously behind the\nbodywork and out of sight. Coil springs occupy the front\nindependent suspension while leaf springs are found in the back\nwith traction bars added.\nDrive-Ability\nWe headed out onto the loop in this red tribute and even the\nworld's biggest geek will gain coolness points by simply piloting\nthis timeless classic. The car had good acceleration and braking,\nand the slightly raked stance and upright ride provides good\nvisibility. Handling is not too shabby, and all functions operate\nas they should. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these\nfunctions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot\nguarantee these functions will be working at the time of your\npurchase.\nA beautiful and powerful rebuilt power plant along with spectacular\npaint make this Camaro worthy of your consideration.

        "1968 Chevrolet Camaro Hardtop\nIn 1968, there were two subtle design cues that differentiated the\n1968 from the 1967Camaro. First, the vent wing windows in the 1967\nmodelwere removed, and longer side windows took their place.\nSecond, a rectangular side marker was added to the front fenders.\nIn 1969, rear side fender vents were added. And that, my friends,\nis how to quickly tell the difference between first generation\nCamaros from the side.And we learned even more about the car when\nCamaro guru Jerry MacNeish was a guest on the Classic Auto Mall\nShow during season one, available on most podcast carriers.\nFor consignment, a 1968 Chevrolet Camaro hardtop with unknown\nmileage but dressed in killer red with black stripes, resto-modded\nwith a high performance V8 engine, and wearing taller shoes forged\nto look factory.\nExterior\nMatador Red pops off the body like a fire engine and is augmented\nby wide, black painted stripes that run in tandem over the hood,\ndecklid, and rear wing. A cowl hood bumps things up a notch and a\ncustom billet grille takes the place of the cubed version. Marker\nlights have been moved to the front lower valance that tops a chin\nspoiler and this all presents a unique face to the '68. Beautifully\npolished 17-inch Chevrolet Rally wheels really create a great\nstance with deep dish holding 315 tires in back and low profiles\nall around. No front bumper, but the back one is in fine shape as\nis the metalwork and trim around the car. In fact, we could find no\nexterior imperfections.\nInterior\nThe standard Camaro black vinyl door panels are super clean with\nwindow cranks at the ready. ProCar low back front bucket seats are\nin place and covered with charcoal cloth. The pattern is copied on\nthe back bench where RJS racing harnesses are provided for the\npassengers and there's also a roll cage for added safety. A 3 spoke\nsteering wheel leads to a custom gauge cluster with six AutoMeter\nwhite faced gauges in a painted black dashboard just beyond the\npolished and tilt steering column. In the center stack, a Kenwood\nAM/FM/CD with Bluetooth illuminates the cabin and Vintage Air\ncontrollers are just below. More glossy black faces the passenger\nfrom the dashboard and a B&M shifter rises confidently from the\ncenter hump. The low pile black carpet is in great shape and the\nheadliner is clean and fully intact.\nDrivetrain\nUnder the cowl hood, a spotless 350ci crate engine with aluminum\nheads, an Edelbrock intake manifold, electronic fuel injection, and\nheaders. Backing it up is a TH400 3-speed automatic transmission\nsending power to a Ford 9\" in back and providing the spark is an EZ\nEFI. Power disc brakes are supplied at all four wheels.\nUndercarriage\nExcept for the occasional cobweb, it's nicely clean underneath. The\ndual exhaust runs from the header to an H-pipe and continues their\njourney to a pair of FlowMaster mufflers before dumping discreetly\nunder the car in the back. Detroit Speed front arms and coil\nsprings make up the suspension while Detroit Speed leaf springs\nlive out back and the entire car has been dropped 2\".\nDrive-Ability\nWe crank the crate to life and it lets the neighbors know it means\nbusiness. The healthy bellow follows us onto the test loop where\nthe car has obvious power underfoot, smooth straight tracking and\nexcellent handling. Braking is on point and acceleration is just a\nfoot tap away. We note the rear tail light and blinker is not\nworking nor are the reverse lights. All other functions work as\nthey should.

        "1968 Camaro Rally Sport Convertible. This vehicle was restored by\nthe prior owner to a very high standard that would be close to\nconcourse for it's merits. This is a solid, rust-free TN car that\nis Butternut Yellow over black vinyl bucket-seat interior with a\nblack vinyl top. The options are: Power Steering, Power Brakes,\nTilt Wheel, AM radio (with Sirius XM radio in glovebox). EXTERIOR:\nThe body panel fitment on this car is exceptional, save for the\ndriver's door which exhibits minor hinge-bushing wear allowing the\nheavy door to droop slightly. Otherwise, the body is straight,\nrust-free and exceptional otherwise. The factory Butternut yellow\npaint was repainted its original color about 7 years ago and still\nhas it's brilliant deep finish with black stripes. All the chrome\nis in great shape with no missing parts. INTERIOR: Black Vinyl seat\ninterior appears to be original and is in near excellent condition.\nCarpets have pulled away from the door sill area slightly but\notherwise has good color and n other wear. Interior is complete.\nDash is intact. Dash pad is not split. The plastic dash gauge-face\nis starting to show some fade, but these have been reproduced and\nare not expensive. The owner preferred to keep this mostly\noriginal, save for the following subjective changes: Current owner\nadded Foose Wheels, the chrome air cleaner, chrome valve covers,\nand a Hurst Shifter. He had the presence of mind to save all the\nfactory original parts for any purists except for the Rally Wheels.\nOn that note, the Owner is willing to swap out the correct rally\nwheels to swap out the Foose wheels if this is important to the\nbuyer. The vaccum-operated sliding headlight doors do not open.\nThey can be manually adjusted, but are not currently working off\nthe mechanism (doesn't affect lighting etc.), 2 or 3 small paint\nchips on the otherwise near perfect finish. 327-V8 has been rebuilt\nand is super quiet/strong. Car starts easily and runs well. Very\nquick! 4 speed manual trans is a joy to drive/shift with no issues.\nThe black convertible vinyl top is in great shape and the plastic\nback window is not hazed over, but very nice. The top works easily\nup/down as it should. The owner has a binder of documentation",

        "1972 Chevrolet Camaro Hardtop\n\"We've learned a lot from Corvette. Here it is. Chevrolet has been\nbuilding the Corvette for 19 years now. And it's still the only two\nseat production sports car made in this country. Over the years,\nwe've learned about axle control, springing, weight distribution,\naerodynamics, braking, and a lot more from the Corvette. And when\nwe first brought out the Camaro five years ago, we put all that\nCorvette learning into its design and engineering.\" From the 1972\nCamaro dealer brochure\nFor consignment, a 1972 Chevrolet Camaro hardtop, showing 89,383\nmiles, but the true miles are unknown. All Camaros were sport\ncoupes and this one was born with a 350ci 2-barrel V8. But today,\nit's all grown up with a 396ci big block with a 4-barrel carburetor\nand some SS goodies that are old school cool. Let's get into\nit.\nExterior\nTwo stage Hugger Orange covers this F-body and that alone would be\ncool enough, but it's got SS stripes that start on the nose, engulf\nthe cowl hood, skip the roof, (appropriately), then track down over\nthe decklid and onto the spoiler, and it's awesome. While we're\nback here let's take in those epic quad tail lights, so muscular\nand streaking into the night like afterburners. Below the chrome\nbumper exists a pair of widespread tailpipes and if this isn't the\nbest angle of the car, it's in the top three! Also in the running\nis the front, a split bumper portrait with gaping center eggcrate\ngrille and an SS chin spoiler down below. Old school meets new\nschool with 17-inch polished American Racing Torque Thrust wheels\nwrapped in 45 series orange painted line tires. This thing is like\na full sized Hot Wheels car! SS 396 is affixed to the fenders and\nthat's in tribute for this faithful dedication. Imperfections\ninclude bubbling in numerous spots, especially down low.\nInterior\nBlack vinyl and plastic doorpanels greet us without fanfare, these\nare generally basic and clean. Cloth seats with vinyl borders show\nsome patina, especially the driver's seat where a tear is observed\non the upper part. In the back, the 2+2 seats are clean and intact\nand the front passenger seat is in fine condition. Our 4 spoke\nsteering wheel is missing the horn button and shares the column\nwith a Sunpro tachometer that fronts the typical sporty Camaro\ninstrument cluster based in hard plastic, textured panels. For\ntunes, we have an AM/FM/Cassette radio, so dig out that box of\ncassettes we know you have! A triple gauge is below the radio and\ninforms the driver on water, oil, and amps. A mean looking, black\nknobbed Hurst shifter rises from the center console, also\nsurrounded in textured plastic and our floor is covered in black\nloop carpet and Chevy rubber mats and it's where we note and\ncelebrate three pedals, and the left two are missing their rubber\nfoot pad. Up top, seatbelts are strapped to the ceiling where we\nfind the black headliner in good condition and a trunk liner sits\ncleanly in the trunk under a spare tire.\nDrivetrain\nClean and ready for show and go, the 396ci V8 sits proudly in the\nbay, topped by a 4-barrel carburetor, shedding exhaust through\nheaders, and tied to a T5 5-speed manual transmission sending the\nspin back to the 10 bolt rear end. And bonus! Power disc brakes\nhave been placed at all four wheels!\nUndercarriage\nVery clean underneath with just hints of surface rust and no oil\npresent! The dual exhaust intersect a pair of FlowMaster mufflers\nand then exit out back through those polished bevel cut tips. A\nchrome differential cover is not only old school but adds some\nbling for those you pass to admire. Suspension includes coil\nsprings in front and leaf springs with traction bars in back.\nDrive-Ability\nThere's no flying under the radar in a Hugger Orange Camaro with\nwide black stripes, polished wheels and dual exhaust, but we'll do\nour best. Especially because we stay on the mall property and by\nnow, the neighbors know what to expect, they've seen it all! The\n396 powers ahead providing gobs of power and the modern tires\nprovide great traction, tracking, and response to the application\nof brakes. Other than the horn not being present and available, all\nother functions in the car work and help transport us back to our\nhigh school days when the cool kids drove cars like this. While\nClassic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at\nthe time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions\nwill be working at the time of your purchase.\nSplit bumper, SS chin spoiler, rear spoiler, \"racing\" stripes. Fun\nstick and three pedals! Not much not to like about this car and\nthere's an entire generation of car people watching the market for\na car like this to appear. This is absolutely another \"Lester from\nAmerican Beauty\" moment. \"It's a 1972 Camaro 396, the car I've\nalways wanted, and now I have it. I rule!\" Fist in the air.

        "This 1968 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 Tribute showcases the iconic\nfirst-generation styling with a performance-oriented twist. Draped\nin Cortez Silver, the sleek body is accented by bold black rally\nstripes that run from nose to tail. The aggressive stance is\nemphasized by 15-inch Rally wheels wrapped in BFGoodrich radials,\nwith P215/60R15 up front and wider P255/60R15 in the rear for\nimproved traction. A black vinyl top adds a touch of\nsophistication, while Z/28 badging and a cowl hood inject a dose of\nmuscle car attitude. Chrome brightwork gleams against the silver\npaint, completing the classic Camaro look that defined an era of\nAmerican performance.\nInside, the cabin maintains a period-correct aesthetic with black\nvinyl bucket seats that offer both style and comfort. The black\ninterior creates a purposeful environment focused on the driver. A\nHurst shifter rises from the floor, ready for quick gear changes.\nModern convenience subtly integrates with classic design through an\nAM/FM cassette player, while auxiliary gauges mounted under the\ndash provide additional engine monitoring capabilities. This\ninterior strikes a balance between preserving the Camaro's original\ncharacter and adding functional upgrades for enhanced\ndrivability.\nLifting the hood reveals a potent 454 cubic inch V8 engine. This\npowerplant breathes through a single 4-barrel Holley carburetor\nmounted on an Edelbrock Victor Jr. intake manifold. Long tube\nheaders feed into a dual exhaust system, likely producing an\naggressive exhaust note. The V8 is paired with a Muncie M20 4-speed\nmanual transmission, putting power to the pavement through a sturdy\n12-bolt rear end. Suspension remains largely stock, with the\naddition of traction bars on the rear leaf springs to help put the\npower down. Braking is handled by power discs up front providing\nreliable stopping power for this muscular Chevy.\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\u2022 454 V8 Engine\n\u2022 Muncie M20 4-Speed Manual Transmission\n\u2022 Single 4-Barrel Holley Carburetor\n\u2022 Edelbrock Victor Jr. Intake Manifold\n\u2022 Long Tube Headers\n\u2022 Dual Exhaust System\n\u2022 12-Bolt Rear Axle\n\u2022 Power Steering\n\u2022 Power Front Disc Brakes\n\u2022 Rear Traction Bars\n\u2022 Cortez Silver Paint\n\u2022 Black Rally Stripes\n\u2022 Black Vinyl Top\n\u2022 15\" Rally Wheels\n\u2022 P215/60R15 Front, P255/60R15 Rear BFGoodrich Radial Tires\n\u2022 Cowl Hood\n\u2022 Z/28 Badging\n\u2022 Chrome Brightwork\n\u2022 Black Vinyl Bucket Seats\n\u2022 Hurst Shifter\n\u2022 AM/FM Cassette Player\n\u2022 Auxiliary Gauges Under Dash\n\u2022 Mr. Gasket Differential Cover\n\u2022 Z/28 Tribute Build\nThis 1968 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 Tribute combines classic muscle car\naesthetics with enhanced performance.

        "1970 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 Hardtop\n\"1970 saw the introduction of the all new Second Generation Camaro.\nThe 1st generation Camaro, (1967-1969), was seen as a hasty\nresponse to the Ford Mustang. It was considered a compromise by\nsome critics. There would be no compromises with this car. Due to\nproduction delays the 1970 Camaro was introduced in February 1970,\nhalfway into the production year. Because of this, some people will\ncall the 1970 Camaro a 1970 1/2, but officially the car is a 1970\nmodel year Camaro. Good things come to those who wait, and this car\nwas met with rave reviews from nearly everyone. Chevrolet had a\nwinner that would run for 12 years.\" Thx tonastyz28.com\nFor consignment, a 1970 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 hardtop with the Vee\nshaped grille and split bumpers, a desirable feature that came as\npart of the RS package on Z28's. It's got classic F-body lines,\nwide double stripes, and a later era 350ci V8 under the hood.\nExterior\nDark Blue Metallic doesn't look bad on too many cars and it looks\ngreat on this one, especially with the complementary white stripes\nthat traverse over the raised hood, the decklid, and up and over\nthe rear spoiler which leans back to shed the wind. The gaping egg\ncrate grille has a metal surround while the round turn signals are\nan RS cue, looking great behind clear lenses. Holes for hood pins\nare in the hood which has a raised cowl flanked by dual sport\nmirrors. Out back, muscular quad tail lights sit below the spoiler\nwhile the chrome bumper contours around the license plate cove and\na pair of exhaust tips split wide and finish up the symmetrical\nrear of the car. 15-inch Chevrolet SS wheels in charcoal look great\nand wear staggered size tires. The paint coverage is very nice, and\nwe note a few imperfections including a ding on the top of the left\nfront fender and some bubbling at the bottom corner of a door.\nInterior\nA plastic header tops the door panels which are constructed of\nstitch patterned black vinyl and the driver's side shows some\nseparation of the insert while the passenger side is in good shape.\nTextured black vinyl covers the front bucket seats which are flat\nby today's sport standard but are in great shape and include a\nheadrest. In the back, the same material is used for the 2+2\nseating, and it looks showroom fresh, as do the molded plastic\nsidewalls. A 3 spoke steering wheel leads to a dash that is canted\non the sides towards the center, creating a cockpit vibe and\nhousing numerous gauges, knobs, and switches and a few holes exist\nwhere items are missing, and this includes the radio. A Hurst\nshifter is floor mounted, rubber booted, and surrounded by black\nloop carpet in good shape. The headliner has some looseness but is\nfully intact and the trunk is completely barren.\nDrivetrain\nPop the hood and a show quality power plant greets you in the form\nof a rebuilt 350ci V8 from 1979, fueled by a 4-barrel sitting on\ntop of an Edelbrock intake manifold. The valve covers and air\nfilter cover are also Edelbrock products while bright red wires\nlead to the sparks and match the MSD ignition box on the firewall.\nA polished alternator and headers also add some eye candy to the\nengine bay. Backing it up is a rebuilt Muncie M20 4-speed manual\ntransmission referring power to the 10 bolt axle out back with 2.56\ngears. Power disc brakes live up front and power drums reside in\nthe back.\nUnderside\nThe theme here is \"a little bit of everything\" amongst the\notherwise clean underside. A little bit of surface rust. A little\nbit of oil on the pan and transmission. A little bit of road dirt\nbut not much. Happily, there's not even a little bit of invasive\nrust. Meanwhile, the dual exhaust enters a pair of Flowmaster\nmufflers before exiting out back and suspension consists of coil\nsprings up front and leaf springs with traction bars out back.\nDrive-Ability\nNo complaints here as the V8 fires right up, sounds great, and\nmoves this Z in fine fashion and with plenty of gusto. Handling is\ngreat, tracking is straight, and the brakes work as they should.\nThings that don't work include the horn, the heater blower, the\nwipers, the reverse lights, and the clock. All other functions work\nas expected. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these\nfunctions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot\nguarantee these functions will be working at the time of your\npurchase.\nHere's a spicy little dish with all the right ingredients. F-body,\nZ28, split bumpers, racing stripes, a wing, a manual transmission,\ndual exhaust, and lovely dark blue paint.

Here's a breakdown of the 1967 Camaro RS's\nhistory: Born from the Mustang's Success: In 1964, Ford's Mustang\nbecame a runaway hit, and Chevrolet scrambled to create a\ncompetitor. The Camaro, built on the upcoming Chevy II Nova\nplatform, arrived in showrooms by fall of 1966. The RS Package: All\nAbout Appearance The RS wasn't a performance package like the SS\n(Super Sport). It focused on aesthetics, offering a sportier look\nfor the base Camaro. The key feature of the 1967 Camaro RS was the\nhidden headlights. They retracted electrically behind motorized\npanels in the grille, creating a cleaner, more aerodynamic front\nend. Other RS additions included distinctive front grille inserts,\nspecial taillight lenses, and RS badges. Sharing the Spotlight: The\nRS package could be combined with the SS package, creating an\n\"\"RS/SS\"\" Camaro. In this case, the RS badging took precedence\nvisually. 1967 was the only year for the unique center console\ndesign and instrument cluster layout offered in the Camaro A Strong\nDebut, but Not the Sales Leader: While the 1967 Camaro, including\nthe RS, was a success, it couldn't dethrone the Mustang in sales\nthat year. Chevy sold 220,906 Camaros compared to Ford's 472,121\nMustangs However, the Camaro, including the RS, did chip away at\nMustang's dominance, paving the way for future sales victories.",

        "Cruisin Classics is excited to present to you today this stunning\n1967 Chevrolet Camaro RS! This Camaro was born back in early\nDecember of '67 with Granada Gold paint and a black vinyl top, but\nit appears before us today with no vinyl top and a high\ndriver-quality respray in a slightly lighter shade of gold with\nsome pearl mixed in to really make it pop in the light. Up front,\nyou'll see a black egg crate grille with \"rs\" badging and the\nhighly desirable, electronically-operated hidden headlights. A\nblack bumblebee stripe, black chin spoiler, chrome faux hood vents,\nand gleaming chrome grille complete the look of this iconic front\nend. The fender badging is in very good condition and properly\nplaced, matching the rest of the badging on the car. Being an RS\npackage car, brightwork abounds with wheel lip molding, drip rail\nmolding, rocker covers, window trim, dual side mirrors, and door\nhandles. Dark tinted windows make this brightwork seem all the more\nbrilliant. The rear of the car features another bright chrome\nbumper, an \"rs\" gas cap, bright tail light trim, and a spoiler on\nthe trunk lid. This Camaro has an awesome stance as it sits atop\nsteel Rally wheels with short-center hubcaps and beauty rings, all\nwrapped in brand new white-letter BF Goodrich Radial T/A's.\nUnder the hood is a very clean and presentable engine bay that is\nhome to a 350ci GM crate V-8. The 350 is topped with chrome\n\"Chevrolet\" valve covers, a GM aluminum intake, an Edelbrock\n4-barrel carburetor, and a chrome Edelbrock air cleaner. Also under\nthe hood is a Be-Cool aluminum radiator with dual electric fans,\nHEI ignition, power steering, power brakes (disc/drum), and working\nA/C. The V-8 is mated to a 700R4 4-speed automatic overdrive\ntransmission that puts power to the pavement via a 10-bolt rear end\nwith 3.73:1 positraction gears. This stellar drivetrain combo is\nperfect for laying some rubber or just cruisin' down the freeway!\nCast manifolds lead back to a newer exhaust with Magnaflow mufflers\nthat sound amazing. While checking out the exhaust you'll see that\nthe bottom of the car was undercoated at some point and it is still\nin fantastic condition.\nOpen the driver's door and the courtesy lights come on to\nilluminate an immaculate black interior. The OEM-style door panels\nare both in great condition and feature factory power windows. Up\nfront are black standard vinyl bucket seats in excellent shape with\nno signs of wear and tear. The bench seat in the back looks like it\nhas never been used. Between the buckets is an exceptionally nice\ncenter console that was installed in 2022. The console has a\nstorage box, a new shifter (also 2022) with the correct shift\nindicator for the 4-speed automatic, and working gauges for fuel,\ntemp, battery, and oil, plus a clock. Up on the dash is a Custom\nAutosound AM/FM bluetooth stereo hooked up to two Classic Car Audio\n6X9s on the rear package tray. Above the stereo are factory climate\ncontrols that provide nice cold A/C and hot heat with a working\nfan. Ahead of the driver on the dash are a speedometer, tachometer,\nand controls for the headlights and the 2-speed wipers. The driver\nis treated to a 3-spoke wood steering wheel from Grant on a tilt\ncolumn. Overhead is a tight black vinyl headliner and underfoot is\na high-quality hook loop carpet. Back in the trunk, you'll find a\nhoundstooth vinyl mat, a set of black rubber Chevy logo floormats,\na jack, and a spare Rally wheel with a BF Goodrich tire.\nIf you're looking for a first generation Camaro you're going to\nwant to take a close look at this '67. This is a very high-quality\nbuild that checks all the boxes - slick paint, great stance,\nhideaway headlights, RS trim package, power steering, power brakes,\npower windows, cold A/C, strong running V-8, automatic overdrive\ntransmission, and a beautiful interior!

        "1972 Chevrolet Camaro SS396\n1972 represented a fairly substantial year in the Camaro world.\nWith impending emission and safety regulations looming, not to\nmention a rise in gas prices, discussion of the F-body being on the\nchopping block was circulating. With morale low and a future\nunknown, 1972 would be the last year for the SS model, speedometers\nwould be reduced from 150 to 130, and the partnership with Hurst\nshifters would end.\nFor consignment, a 1972 Chevrolet Camaro SS396, a true LS3 U code\ncar that is one of just 970 produced in 1972. This one has been\nfitted with a Holley Sniper EFI system, an M22 Rock Crusher\ntransmission, and some other performance enhancements. As we write\nthis, the Camaro Nationals is a few weeks away from taking place\nhere at Classic Auto Mall, so if you have interest in this car, do\nnot hesitate to contact a Car Specialist before 1,000 Camaro\nenthusiasts descend on the mall.\nExterior\nLooking at the 1972 Camaro sales brochure, Mojave Gold was used for\nthe SS press car and that's what we have on this car, this one\nfeaturing a cowl hood, solid bumper, and an SS emblem on the grille\nthat became coarser in 1972. A three piece sharply angled rear\nspoiler was standard on the SS and so was dual exhaust which we see\nrepresented by straight tailpipes under the rear valance.\nContrasting black paint fills the rear fascia around the ultra cool\nquad taillights and license plate cutout. The smooth profile is\nuninterrupted by side molding but does wear an SS396 fender badge.\n15-inch SS Sport wheels are wrapped in staggered size tires for an\nextra muscular stance. Chrome and polished metal elements of the\ncar are in great shape and so is the paint with the exception of\nsome small areas of bondo repair and paint drips. Most panel gaps\nare good with a few that are less than perfect.\nInterior\nThis car now sports a black interior that starts with clean and\nunmarred plastic and vinyl door panels with an armrest between two\nstorage pockets. Tall sport bucket seats in a stitch patterned and\nbuttoned design are firmly shaped and showing no wear and the back\n2+2 seats repeat the pattern and condition. A standard steering\nwheel features an SS emblem and leads to the dashboard that's\nfronted by the Holley Sniper screen. Behind that screen are the six\nstandard gauges including a tachometer in a textured plastic dash\npanel. Climate controls are to the left and show a bit of patina\nand in center is an AM radio looking very period at a time when\neven rock stations were on AM. In the center console emerges the\nshifter and more molded plastic construction leading to a storage\nbin between the seats. Loop carpet in black covers the floor with a\nset of SS carpeted mats on top and the glossy vinyl headliner is in\nfine condition. The trunk is covered with a plaid vinyl mat.\nDrivetrain\nUnder the hood is a very clean and very large 402ci motor date\ncoded to 1971 and topped by a Holley Sniper EFI system, all backed\nby a 1970 vintage Muncie M22 4-speed manual transmission that sends\nthe horsepower to the rear 10 bolt with 2.56 gears. Power brakes\nare supplied with discs in front and drums in the rear.\nUndercarriage\nRelatively clean with driver quality conditions underneath with\nsurface rust coating the driveshaft, headers, and other parts. It's\nnot dirty and there are no oil leaks visible, only some residual\noil on the oil pan. The dual exhaust encounters a pair of\nFlowmaster mufflers and then exits out back. Suspension consists of\ncoil springs up front and mono leaf springs with CalTrac bars out\nback.\nDrive-Ability\nNo need to pump the gas here as the EFI system delivers fuel with\nthe turn of the key and the info screen lights up like a Christmas\ntree. The 402 roars to life and we roll this gold F-body onto the\nloop where we find power on tap and a sure footed ride in a\ncomfortable cabin. Most items work as intended with the exception\nof the horn, the reverse lights, the speedometer, and the odometer.\nWhile Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were\nworking at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these\nfunctions will be working at the time of your purchase.\nEven with the modifications, this is still one of 970 1972 Camaro\nSS396 cars. Options for buyers may include leaving it as is and\nenjoying the electronic Holley system for reliable starts and fuel\nmanagement or seek out a 1972 era 396 and reconfigure things to\nstock specifications. Either way, you'll have a rare car, a good\nrunner, and an attractive F-body with which to enjoy the open\nroad!\n1Q87U2N165237\n1-Chevrolet\nQ-Camaro\n87-2 Door Hardtop Sport Coupe\nU-396ci 4bbl 240hp LS3 V8\n2-1972\nN-Norwood, OH Assy Plant\n165237-Sequential Unit Number\nTRIM TAG\nST 72 12387-1972 Camaro 2 Door Hardtop Sport Coupe\nBDY N2317142-Norwood Body #\nTR 778-Tan Standard Vinyl Buckets\nPNT 63 63-Mohave Gold\n03D-4th Week March\nA51-Bucket Seats\nZ27-Super Sport Package\nLS3-396ci 240hp Turbofire V8, SS\nClassic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and\ncollectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate\ncontrolled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8\nacres!).

        "The first-generation Camaro is an enduring and extremely desirable sporty car that requires virtually no introduction today. Despite large production numbers, quality early Camaros are quite rare today. Restored and upgraded for an even better driving experience while maintaining classic looks, this \u201968 Camaro is ready to enjoy as desired and originally intended, without the headaches associated with a \u201cmatching numbers\u201d museum piece.\nVehicle Story\nFrom its launch in late 1966 for the inaugural 1967 model year, Chevrolet\u2019s sporty F-Body Camaro quickly stole the thunder of archrival Ford and its Mustang. In addition to its winning style, the Camaro\u2019s huge option list made it possible for buyers to literally build their own Camaro, ranging from economical runabout to fire-breathing muscle car. The sleek and lightweight Camaro was perfectly suited to SCCA Trans-Am road racing and in that wildly popular theater, it won back-to-back championships (1968-69) in the hands of team owner Roger Penske and driver/engineer Mark Donohue. On the dragstrip, the Camaro immediately carved out a fierce reputation with Bill \u201cGrumpy\u201d Jenkins and Dave Strickler virtual fixtures in Super Stock winners\u2019 circles during the late 1960s. Over the next five-plus decades, the Camaro\u2019s popularity has only strengthened, with its excellent basic design remaining at the leading edge of automotive culture and adapting itself incredibly well to the changing times and automotive tastes.\nVehicle Overview\nWhile finished as a stock-appearing 1968 Chevrolet Camaro with the upscale Rally Sport option package, this eye-catching example carries a surprise package under the hood in the form of a modern 6.0-liter GM LS2 V-8 engine delivering far greater performance than the robust original specification ever could. Just 2,500 post-build miles are indicated at the time of writing.\nExterior\nFinished in Tuxedo Black with iconic factory-style pearlescent White Rally stripes, this sophisticated \u201968 Camaro carries an understated, yet decidedly performance-oriented presence throughout. Notwithstanding some surface rust in places, the Camaro continues to present very well. Front and rear spoilers, a \u201969 Cowl Induction style hood, Rally Sport pop-up headlights, upscale trim, and Corvette-style Chevrolet Rally wheels deliver considerable curb appeal. The headlight kit is electric which provides far more reliability & fully opens and closes when compared to more conventional air pressure systems.\nInterior\nFeaturing supportive custom bucket seats trimmed in Black with smart Red contrast stitching, the Camaro interior is updated with a wood-rimmed, three-piece custom steering wheel, and a four-gauge Auto Meter cluster to the console, monitoring battery voltage, transmission-fluid temperature, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. A modern, yet classic appearing \u201ccue ball\u201d shift knob maintains a 1960s appearance. Welcome creature comforts include a modern air-conditioning system.\nMechanical\nWhile factory-rated at about 400 horsepower, depending upon the application and chosen transmission, the Camaro\u2019s LS2 engine delivers even more power and performance with a Holley Sniper EFI system and cold-air induction kit. Chevrolet-scripted rocker covers convey a classic vibe with a Black finish for a modern twist and the coil packs are repositioned with four to each inner fender. The car also appears to have an air shock system although the seller reports this component is currently non-functional. The low-restriction, full-length dual exhaust system delivers a throaty note with Flowmaster mufflers as the Camaro accelerates through the updated 3-speed automatic transmission with overdrive and power steering. Power front disc/rear drum brakes provide stopping power via a dual-circuit master cylinder.\nthe Auto transmission is a4L80E Performance Transmission\nHistory Highlights\nAccording to its VIN and Body/Trim tag, this 1968 Chevrolet Camaro began life when it rolled off the Norwood, Ohio F-Body assembly line as an original V-8 Camaro Sport Coupe with Black standard bucket-seat interior and Butternut Yellow paint finish. As offered, it is a perennially desirable classic first-generation Camaro with Rally Sport features, choice updates, and of course, a mighty modern LS2 fuel-injected powerplant and 3-speed automatic transmission with overdrive.\nWhat We Think\nThe first-generation Camaro is an enduring and extremely desirable sporty car that requires virtually no introduction today. Despite large production numbers, quality early Camaros are quite rare today. Restored and upgraded for an even better driving experience while maintaining classic looks, this \u201968 Camaro is ready to enjoy as desired and originally intended, without the headaches associated with a \u201cmatching numbers\u201d museum piece.",

        "1967 Chevrolet Camaro Coupe\nThe first-generation Chevrolet Camaro appeared in Chevrolet\ndealerships in September 1966 for the 1967 model year on a\nbrand-new rear-wheel drive GM F-body platform and was available as\na 2-door, 2 plus 2 seat, hardtop, (no \"B\" or center pillar), or\nconvertible, with the choice of either a straight-six or V8 engine.\nThe first-generation Camaro was built through the 1969 model\nyear.\nThis 67 as we can see, had undergone a recent restoration with some\nmajor changes to the original configuration of the power plant. The\nbody and frame have been kept OEM. Bought from the keyboardist for\nBon Jovi, David Bryan, it has a little provenance, and a lot of\npower.\nExterior\nMarina Blue respray of 3 coats base and 3 coats clear, and it\nshines like a crazy diamond. Very nice paint, complete with the\nwrap around front hood stripe in white and SS badge. This car also\ncarries the RS package, consisting of hidden headlights that work\nperfectly and RS specific taillight bezels, (the all-important Z22\nRPO code). Rocker chrome, and wheel well surround trim is\nexcellent. Small bumpers are also excellent. A white hardtop draped\nwith vinyl is blemish free and tops this Mustang eater off\nperfectly. On all 4 corners are stock blue steel wheels with dog\ndish caps, wrapped by black sidewall tires, correct for the period\nbut updated. Also need to mention the small but sexy rear spoiler\nfloating above the trunk, (actually its attached).\nInterior\nI'm breaking protocol and starting with the trunk which you have to\nsee to believe. All wrapped in green and black houndstooth vinyl it\ncontains the spare, (wrapped in the houndstooth vinyl), a wheeled\njack, and crowbar neatly displayed within the houndstooth. Now we\ncan move to the meat and potatoes of the interior...the passenger\ncompartment. Swinging the doors, we are greeted with excellence.\nExcellent door panels in blue, excellent buckets in blue vinyl with\nsome snazzy white stripe highlights bordering the bolsters and\nflanking a dual cupholder. This rests on the black textured console\nwhich houses the Hurst shifter. As we move to the dash there are 3\naftermarket gauges hanging below the dash, and in front of the\nshifter. These monitor oil, volts, and water temp. Moving up the\nangled inward dash in blue, there are a few chromed knobs and dual\ndeep dish round gauges framed by an original steering wheel, all\njust in peachy condition (actually they are blue and black). Noted\non the original steering column is a tachometer so you can avoid\nthe red zone. Beautiful carpet below, and a tight headliner above\nand we have covered the interior.\nDrivetrain\nTake a deep breath, here we go! The original numbers matching block\nand crankshaft were utilized, but inside were placed KB\nhypereutectic .020 pistons and rings with a 9.5 to 1 compression,\nScat rods, a polished and balanced crank. Aluminum heads are\nattached with titanium seats stainless valves, and .500 lift\nsprings. A Comp Thumper Cam with .491 int, and .491 exhaust lift,\nis of the hydraulic variety, Howard lifters, roller rockers, and\nsealed with all Fel-Pro gaskets. Topping it off is a Quickfuel 650\nCFM carburetor, and Edelbrock intake manifold. This 350ci mill\nexhales through Hedman Headers and a Flowmaster exhaust.\nTransmission is a 4-speed manual Muncie, (1969 vintage), and the\nrear is a 12 bolt 3.73 posi edition. Whew!\nUndercarriage\nVisually edible, (aka eye candy), near perfect, and well taken care\nof on any rust fronts because it does not exist...anywhere! Solid\nas a rock. 4 Wheel 9\" drum brakes non power assisted are\ninstalled.\nDrive-Ability\nLights quickly, and just listening to the exhaust sound of the\nidle, you know you are in for a ride. This car does not disappoint,\nas it runs like a deer, stings like a bee, and handles like a\nbutterfly, all while looking great and turning heads. It has to be\na female car, because it can do more than one thing at once...but I\ndigress, and back to the wonderful handling, ride, and\nacceleration. She is just a great driver whose power goes on longer\nthan our test area. And the color...deeper than your eyes can\nsee.\nKudos to the restorers...with an excellent example of the Camaro\n350 SS coupe, as it has no stones unturned, plenty of power, and\ngreat looks interior and exterior. She's a multitasker, and a cool\ndriver right out of 1967, and she will eat a Mustang of the same\nera anytime.

        "Welcome to Street Dreams as we celebrate our 25th year in the\nclassic and muscle car business. Americans have had a love affair\nwith Chevrolet's Camaro since it went on sale on Sept. 29, 1966 to\ncompete with Ford's wildly successful Mustang. Those first\ngeneration cars (1967-1969) became legendary when Roger Penske and\nMark Donohue's Camaros won the SCCA Trans-Am series in 1968 and\n1969, and they've been in demand ever since. But the early,\nchrome-bumper 2nd generation cars (1970-1973) proudly illustrate\nwhat is without question one of the cleanest designs to ever come\nfrom Detroit.

        "1969 SS 350 CAMARO RESTO-MOD\nThe vin and trim tags verify this car was built in the first week of October 1969. The build plant was in Norwood, Ohio. It came with the 350 motor and automatic transmission. It is an X-44 model NON-SS Sport Coupe. The Daytona yellow body color, black vinyl top, and black with yellow deluxe interior are authentic to the original build.\nI, the owner purchased the camaro from its 2nd owner in August of 2004. The 2nd owner had the car since 1969 and bought it from Mohawk Chevy in Schenectady, NY. The 2nd owner related to me the current owner that the 1st owner had purchased it at Mohawk and soon realized it wasn't suiting his needs in 69. He traded it back to them for a larger sedan.\nI, the current owner drove the car for approximately 3 years the way I purchased it from the 2nd owner. After that decidedto restore the car to better than new condition and upgrade it to an SS model. I went into the full restore with the mine set of \"I could have ordered this car with all these options in 69\".\nBetween 2007 and 2010 I did a \"frame off\" restoration. I have photos documentation and receipts to back up the full build.\nThe camaro has matching number original drive train. The motor was refreshed completely top to bottom to \u201cSS\u201d power and operating specs. The distributor was changed to an electronic system for reliability. The intake manifold was replaced with an Edelbrock aluminum 4-bbl style and a new 600 CFM carburetor performance series. A K&N open air element breather sits on top. The valve covers were replaced with a set of aluminum black grooved covers to match the breather on top the carburetor. The fuel tank, fuel pump, all fuel lines, and fuel gauge sending unit were replaced. The M-38 3speed automatic transmission was rebuilt to factory specs. The rear axle is a non-positraction 10 bolt with all new fluids, seals, bearings, and gears (308). Drive shaft U-joints were replaced with shaft. The brakes were originally 14\u201d 4 wheel drums on steel wheels. I upgraded to 15\u201d magnum 500 wheels (which were an option in 1969) and a front disk brakes with slotted drilled rotors kit from CCP. The master cylinder and booster assembly was also replaced at the same time as the CCP kit install. The rear brakes are still drums, but completely gone through and replaced/built to factory specs. In February of 2024 I installed another new booster and master cylinder. The cooling system has a new radiator, thermostat, water pump, fan clutch, and heater core installed. Belts and hose have all been replaced.\nThe air conditioning is factory original, but I installed all new hoses and related components. Compressor was rebuilt and converted to R-134. The system was just serviced recently and given a clean bill of health with no leaks and blowing cold.\nThe power steering is factory original. The belts, hoses, and all related components were replaced. The front suspension was completely gone through and replaced with new parts. The rear suspension was also replaced with new parts at the same time.\nThe dual exhaust system was custom built from the factory exhaust manifolds back, including a \u201cX\u201d pipe and flow master \u201c50\u201d series mufflers.\nIn June/July of 2023 the camaro was fully serviced including oil, filter, fluids checked, and tires were replaced with GOODRICH TA Radials 215/70/15 raised white letters (DOT-CODE 05-23). The camaro has had less than 500 miles put on it since then. In February of 2024 the battery was replaced with a 12V DIE HARD Battery.\nThe vehicle spent several years in upstate New York before I acquired it from the 2nd owner. Therefore it had rust in all the usual places common on these year camaros. I elected during the full restoration to not repair the rust, but rather replace with new sheet metal reproduction panels. To this end, virtually all body panels are new and rust free. The only original sheet metal on the camaro is the floor pans and the roof. The pans at the time of restoration were good. I applied gator guard undercoating to them for added rust prevention and sound deadening. The entire under area was also gator guarded prior to installing the drive train. The roof had only minor surface rust that was repaired before it was primed, painted, and the new vinyl top was installed. The windshield and rear glass were both replaced. The side glass is all original. The body was painted Daytona Yellow per trim code. The paint was PPG band base-coat clear-coat. All exterior marking lights, trim pieces, spoilers, grill, decals, and \u201cSS\u201d emblems are new. They were all replaced after painting was completed. No exterior antennae was installed, there is a hidden one in the trunk.\nThe interior on the camaro was completely replaced to factory specs. The only original pieces retained were the seat frames, the console, the am-fm radio, the metal dash, and the headliner. Dynamat sound deadening material was installed under the carpet. The seats were completely rebuilt and recovered with OEM correct material. The console was rebuilt and I added the four gauge instrument cluster that was optional in 69. The original speedometer read 99,244 Miles when I started the full restoration. It broke while turning 100,000 miles and I replaced it whith one for an \u201cSS\u201d model. It currently reads less than 2,000 miles. That is the miles put on the car since finishing the full restoration in 2010. I added the tach and clock at the same time which were all options in 69.\nThis 1969 SS Chevy Camaro Resto-Mod is for all practical purposes a new 69 Camaro. Due to failing health, It is very difficult for me to get in and out of the car. It is still great fun for me to drive and I love it. The above work has all been document in photos and receipts which I have all of, these things will go with the car. The Camaro really does shut, gap, and drive better than a new one you could have bought in 69. It's time to let someone else enjoy the car!",

        "1969 Chevrolet Camaro Hardtop\nIn the United States, we have the ability to exercise our free\nwill. And if that means modifying a car to our liking, so be it!\nAnd We The People have been doing that for quite some time with\nsome of the earliest cultural transitions taking place in the hot\nrod era of the 50's. When Camaros came along, and survived, they\nbecame the canvases for expressions of artistic and performance\ninterpretation by the hundreds. No, thousands!\nFor consignment, a Camaro masterpiece. A '69 Camaro that was born\nin Norwood, Ohio and over the years received a makeover, heart\ntransplant, new shoes, and many other goodies for show and go. It's\na fantastic build and a striking car that's ready to save you from\nthe time and money of restoring a barn find. This is turnkey\ngoodness at its American best!\nExterior\nThere are not many color combinations as hot as black and red. And\nthis red car features a matte black cowl hood with intersecting\nfender hash stripes on steroids! The grille is red, but the\nheadlight bezels are black. The rear fascia picks up the matte\nblack and is the ideal background for the Z/28 emblem and\ntaillights. Take a close look at those smoked tail lights, the\nthree sections are stacked and canted outward but face towards the\nrear, a bit of geometrical trickery that is often overlooked. With\nthe use of 2 inch drop spindles, the car sits low over the 18-inch\nRidler chrome 5-spoke wheels. The chrome bumpers and metal work\naround the car are in great shape. For flaws, we note some drips\nwhere an overzealous paint gun stayed too long, some rust on the\nlower pinch welds, a dent on one rocker panel and a scrape on one\nwheel arch. If you're not looking for these things, they're\notherwise unobtrusive.\nInterior\nThe black vinyl doors are lined with horizontal stitched lines in\none inch rows. That pattern is mirrored in the front bucket seats\nand the rear bench. A Grant GT 3 spoke steering wheel is at the\nhelm and is a vast ergonomic departure from the stock wheel. The\nsquare gauge pods now house round white faced gauges, backlit in\nblue and with digital readouts. An AM/FM/CD radio with USB and aux\nports also adds blue light to the interior while four more gauges\nare perched on the center console canted towards the driver. A\nHurst shifter takes its rightful place in the center in a carbon\nfiber trimmed base. Black loop carpet fills the foot wells where we\nalso find some external speakers. The headliner is intact but could\nbenefit from some freshening to tighten things up.\nDrivetrain\nA 383ci stroker V8 is under the cowled hood with an Edelbrock 1406\n4-barrel carburetor sitting atop it. A Tremec T56 6-speed manual\ntransmission rows the gears and sends power back to the 10-bolt\nrear with a 3.08 ratio. Power disc brakes are a definite upgrade\nand found at both ends. Hooker Super Comp headers get things\nstarted on the exhaust end of things. The car is also equipped with\nelectric fans, an HEI distributor, and air conditioning. The engine\nbay is clean and show worthy with bright additions and flame\nengraved valve covers.\nUndercarriage\nGenerally clean underneath but not on par with the top side of the\ncar. There is surface rust in the usual places including the rear\ndiff, suspension components, and the frame. Flaking rust is seen\nalong the belly pan where it meets the rocker panels and there's a\nspot of invasive rust on a floor panel. Some residual oil on the\noil pan and some oil on the rear diff coming from either the pinion\nseal or cover. The dual exhaust connects with an H pipe and\ncontinues twinning down the length of the car where they meet\nFlowmaster mufflers, then exit just beyond the rear fenders with\nonly the very tips of the chrome tails showing. Independent\nsuspension is in front with coil overs and leaf springs with\ntraction bars are on the back. Our cnsignor also states air shocks\nare present.\nDrive-Ability\nHere we go, into the wild blue yonder, or in this case the wild\nblack asphalt of our test loop. The car fires up with mucho gusto\nand like a hot tamale, rolls out onto the track. The seats are\ncomfortable, the steering wheel provides confidence, and the Hurst\nshifter is the star of the show. We're able to monitor temperature\nand systems through a myriad of gauges, something not afforded to\nall Camaros in 1969. She runs strong, handles well, and stops on a\ndime. Oh, and sounds pretty darn good, too with the only flaw being\nreverse lights that don't illuminate. We can't wait to get this one\nback so we can put it on display for all to enjoy!\nFinished and well done Camaro projects with individual expressions\nand customizations don't usually last long at the mall. Someone\ntook this canvas and painted a red rocket with black highlights, a\nstrong engine, some modern conveniences, and a stance that is\nsimply cool. Freedom dictates action, so don't get stuck in the\nstarting gate.

        "By 1969, Chevrolet\u2019s first-generation \u201cF-Body\u201d Camaro had truly come of age, with strong sales driven by its handsome styling, huge option list and brilliant racing success. Conceived and built with development spearheaded by Chevrolet\u2019s Vince Piggins as the GM division\u2019s new SCCA Trans-Am racing contender, the RPO Z28 option package was quietly introduced for the Camaro in 1967 to homologate the car for racing. Careful refinements for 1968 and 1969 further enhanced the concept, with the latter showing a slightly restyled front and rear. At its heart, the Z28 featured a high-winding and tough small-block V-8 engine, combining the basic dimensions of the 327 cylinder block and short-stroke 283 crank to yield 302 CI\u2014just inside the SCCA-mandated displacement limit for Trans-Am racing. Carefully developed underpinnings and other race-inspired tweaks maximized the factory-underrated 290 HP output of the Z28.\nExtensive nut and bolt restoration!\nThis Rare Frost Green (paint code 59) 1969 Z28 is a beautifully restored example and includes:\nDZ-suffix warranty replacement 302/290 HP engine\nMuncie M-20 4-speed manual transmission\nRare radio delete\nOriginal 12 Bolt rear end with 3.73 Posi\nOriginal 1111480 dual point distributor with 9D2 date\n8000 RPM tachometer\nPower brakes\nRare manual steering\nOriginal door panels and seats\nOriginal console\nFirestone wide oval 15 inch tires\nRare non-rear spoiler option\nX77 base Z28 trim package\nNew DZ carburetor 3923289-DZ\nOriginal intake and air cleaner\nFactory 15X7 Rally wheels\nNew original style mandrel bent exhaust\nFactory cowl induction\nOriginal Norwood trim tag",

        "Gateway classic cars of Nashville is proud to digitally present to\nyou this 1968 Chevrolet Camaro. Covered in a slick dark gray paint\nthis resto mod 1968 Camaro is not missing a trick, this car is, in\nmy opinion, the total package. It looks great, has the power to fry\nthe tires all while listening to your favorite CD setting on your\npower leather seat in the air conditioning. See? Total package !\nPop the hood and the expected 350 cubic inch small block has been\nreplace with modern muscle by way of an LS 3. 6.2 Liters of fun and\nthis one has the right goodies attached to it. Twin 6266 Turbos\npush air thru a Treadstone air to air intercooler and then in to\nthe Holley LS High ram intake feeding the LS all it wants. The\nexhaust then exits the car through stainless steel just in front of\nthe rear tires. All this power is then sent to the PTC 4L80e 4\nspeed automatic transmission and a 12 bolt with posi carrier and\n3.73 gears split the power to the sticky Micky's P315/50r -17 tires\n. Bet the front gets a lot lighter when the go pedal is pressed\nquickly.Braking is handled with 4 wheel disc with drilled and\nslotted rotors on every corner and Wilwood master cylinder. Got to\nhave some serious whoa with all this go.All this power and torque\nneeds a solid base to contain it and this car is set. Strong arm\ntubular A arms with adjustable air bags and rack and pinion\nsteering up front. The 12 bolt is held in place with a adjustable 4\nlink and adjustable Fox air bag in the rear. Sub frame connectors\ntie the two together.Now most cars built this way have a fiberglass\nseat that is bolted to the floor and if you are lucky, a 1/2 in of\nfoam to sit on and no carpet. This ride was fully dynomatted before\nthe interior was installed, black carpet and leather seats work\nwith the dark gray paint and a B&M Quick silver shifter has\nbeen tastefully included in the center console. A custom dash\nhouses the gauges needed so no need to look under the ash tray\nwhere most a bolted. Power seat, Air conditioning and AM/FM with CD\nplayer.See?! Total package. This is a car that a lot of people have\nput together in their minds and on paper, it is a blend of old\nschool cool, modern performance and luxury. Please buy this car\nbefore i start checking my 401k. Hey, if not now, when?Sale held\npursuant to permit No. 19289 of department of licenses granted the\n14th day of August 2015.",

        "Looking at the collector car market over the past several years,\nit's obvious that there are few safer places to park some cash than\nin a 1969 Camaro of any kind. But if it's muscle car royalty that\nyou're after, it doesn't get much better than a car like this 1969\nChevrolet Camaro Z/28. With a date code correct 302 DZ V8 mated to\na Muncie 4-speed manual and wearing a diabolical Tuxedo\nBlack-on-black color combination, this real-deal Z/28 looks is an\nabsolute slam-dunk. These cars have been red hot for some time, and\nwhen an opportunity to grab one in great colors with a bulletproof\npedigree comes up, well, isn't it time you owned your dream\ncar?\nThis beautifully restored Z/28 was comprehensively restored to NCRS\nstandards back in the late-1990's and it's been so well-cared for\nand loved it's still an absolute stunner in person. Finished in\nTuxedo Black and White stripes, a huge upgrade over the car's\noriginal Code 61 Burnished Brown, it's the epitome of what people\nimagine when they think about a 1st generation Z/28. After almost\nthree decades, it's starting to show some of its age, with minor\nimperfections acquired through the years and signs of older\nprep-work becoming a bit more visible than when the car was fresh,\nbut this car still presents very well despite some of those\ndemerits. It's a higher-end, driver-quality ride that looks much\nyounger than the build date would suggest, with a straight body,\ntight lines, and great gaps providing the background to the deep,\nshiny finish. Other than the color change, the restorers took no\nliberties, and everything is pretty much as it was when the car was\ndelivered new, including the egg-crate grille, chin spoiler, bright\nbumpers with oversized optional bumper guards, and the traditional\nducktail spoiler out back. The cowl induction hood is a steel piece\nthat remains functional, feeding the high-winding 302 a steady diet\nof cool, clean air from the base of the windshield. The white\nstripes follow the Z/28 correct pattern, narrow at the front and\nwider at the rear so that they appear parallel when viewed from the\nfront. All the chrome and stainless is polished up, and it wears\ncorrect badges in all the right places.\nThe code 711 Black Vinyl bucket seat interior is anything but\nbasic, and the black-on-black combination is really the best choice\nfor a vintage Z/28 (let the letters from the Cortez Silver fans\nroll in). Period-perfect seat covers, including the\nfederally-mandated headrests, were installed when the car was\nrestored, but with such great care spent keeping the interior in\ntop-shape, everything still looks and feels fresh inside. This car\nhas several choice options, including a lovely woodgrained center\nconsole filled with white-faced auxiliary gauges at the mast, and\nthe factory gauges just beyond that gorgeous Rosewood steering\nwheel feature a correct AC tach with a 6000 RPM redline. There have\nbeen no real deviations from stock in this high-point F-body, which\nmeans even the Delco AM/FM radio remains in the dash and a polished\nHurst shifter manages the gears, while period-perfect pieces like\nthe plush black carpets, taut headliner, matching door panels, and\nsuper-clean rear seat prove that that nothing was overlooked in\nthis build. In back, the spacious trunk offers correct\nspatter-finish paint and includes a reproduction mat and a\nfull-sized spare tire assembly with jack.\nThe Z/28's legendary DZ-code 302 cubic inch V8 was created by\nstuffing a 283 crank inside a 327 block, and the over-square design\nmeans the Z loves to rev. Some of GM's best-flowing double hump\nheads were installed up top to feed the snarling small block, and a\ndate correct Holley 4053 carburetor (rebuilt in 2019) makes sure it\ndoesn't starve. Neatly detailed for show, the engine bay features\nChevy Orange paint on the block, proper finned aluminum valve\ncovers, and reproduction hoses and clamps throughout. Even the\noriginal exhaust manifolds were retained and left raw, so they look\njust like they would have moments after rolling off the\ntransporter, and the black snorkeled air cleaner up top is the\ncoupe de grace. All Z/28s were Muncie 4-speeds and this particular\nM20 hooks to a rugged 12-bolt out back with 3.73s inside, as well\nas a correct Gardner transverse dual exhaust system. The front end,\nall four springs, and master cylinder were rebuilt/replaced in the\nlast handful of years, and even the engine was refreshed with a\nhost maintenance items, meaning this Z/28 is ready for the road\ntoday. Shiny 15-inch Rally wheels wear proper Goodyear Wide Tread\nGT white-letter tires, finishing off the period-perfect\npresentation in a big way.\nBeautifully finished and an absolute blast to drive, this is a\nhigh-quality Z/28 that probably counts as an investment but remains\nready to drive. Don't miss this chance, call today!",

The current owner\nbelieves this stunning Daytona Yellow (51) Super Sport to be an\noriginal survivor that's led a pampered and sheltered life and was\ntreated to a recent high quality respray. Under the hood, you'll\nfind a highly detailed engine bay housing the numbers matching\n350ci engine and factory air-conditioning which still blows cold.\nTake a peek underneath and you'll spot a smooth shifting Turbo 350\ntrans, 12-bolt rear differential, and an undercarriage that rivals\na full rotisserie restoration.

        "1970 Chevrolet Camaro - Gorgeous first year example of the iconic redesigned 2nd-gen Camaro with a rare factory color combo and classy performance styling!

Powered by it's original 350-V8 and Turbo-350 automatic transmission with a 3.31 geared 10-bolt rear. Engine was rebuilt with upgraded 300hp Super Sport add-ons such as a Holley 4bbl carb, correct cam, correct exhaust manifolds, special stainless dual exhaust system and an updated electronic ignition. Also nicely optioned with factory power steering and power front disc brakes. Car runs out strong and really looks the part on a nicely restored set of 15\" Rally wheels with BFG white letter radial tires. Exterior has received one older re-paint in the factory correct \"Autumn Gold\" and still looks outstanding with the exception of one small blemish on passenger side sail-panel (pictured). A super sport front valence has been added as well as trunk spoiler for a more aggressive look and the chrome/stainless trim shows excellent. Body is very straight from front to back with great gaps/lines and seems to retain all of it's original sheetmetal/floors still showing the original stampings. Interior boasts a wonderful contrast in factory two-tone saddle tan vinyl throughout with bucket seats, console and staple-shifter. Inside is like a true time capsule and also appears to be mostly \"preserved\" with only a couple minor blemishes such as a pinhole in the headliner and seams beginning to seperate on the driver's sun visor. Engine bay is nicely detailed with a dual-snorkel air cleaner, finned valve covers, shielding and assembly line chalk markings on firewall.

        "1967 Chevrolet Camaro RSHardtop\nOf the 220,906 Camaros produced in 1967, about 65,000 of them had\nthe RS appearance package. You could also get the SS performance\npackage mixed with the RS appearance package for a double punch,\nbut stats on how many of the 34,411 SS model contained the package\nare unknown. Meanwhile, the covered headlights, revised tail\nlights, badging and other attributes make the RS a sought after\nCamaro derivative.\nFor consignment, a 1967 RS that the owner dreamed about and was\nwilling to purchase long distance, then tolerate mechanical issues,\nand finally fixing the mechanical problems with a new engine and\nelectronic fuel injection to create a reliable, fast, and enjoyable\nRS. It's a real Z22 RS '67 in its correct color!\nExterior\nTwo stage Bolero Red envelopes this car which is enhanced by the\nblack nose stripe surrounding the RS emblem on the fenders. The\nhidden headlights, this car's \"coup de grace\", is an epic styling\ncue and the headlight doors retain the geometric pattern of the\ngrille which creates a bit of a sinister face. The RS badge in\nlowercase letters is in the center of the black grille and we note\nsome checking on the rim detail of the grille and headlights. A\ncowl hood adds to the meanness of the look, and a 327 badge on the\nfender, as we'll learn is not exactly what resides under the hood.\nThe tail lights are solid red as the reverse lights are found on\nthe lower valance for the RS variant. 15-inch rally wheels with\nslightly wider tires in back provide the roll. The paint, gaps, and\nmetal work including bumpers are in overall nice condition, making\nthis car fall squarely into the driver quality plus category. We\nnote some touch up on a door edge and a slight dent to one wheel\nwell trim piece.\nInterior\nThe standard red door panels look great in red. Fantastic condition\nwith a bit of warpage of the armrest/door pull but minor in its\nimperfection. The red vinyl buckets are of stock design and good\ncondition as is the back bench with three sets of seatbelts. The RS\ncenter cap highlights the 3-spoke steering wheel, also in red,\nwhile dual gauge set in rounded coves let you know your speed up to\n120 mph, fuel capacity, and other information indicated by idiot\nlights. The center stack has a vent, vent/heat controls, and an\nAM/FM radio housed in black panel. The center console is where we\nfind the automatic gear shifter, a small T-shaped handle in a\nsimple base with indicator. A small storage bin is just behind the\nshifter. The red loop style carpet covers the floor in fine\ncondition, protected by Camaro branded floor mats. This red loop\ncarpet was also used to cover the floor of the trunk and looks\nclean. The headliner is like a military bedsheet, tight and wrinkle\nfree.\nDrivetrain\nAfter some ongoing battles with the 327, the consignor replaced it\nwith a 350ci V8, added electronic fuel injection, and kept in place\nthe Powerglide 2-speed automatic transmission. A 10-bolt rear is in\nthe back and brakes slow this hot car down, discs in front and\ndrums in the rear. The engine bay is spotless and show worthy with\nthe block and valve covers painted orange and a chrome Edelbrock\nair filter element cover.\nUndercarriage\nThings are very clean underneath with the only surface rust noted\nis on the control arms up front. The dual exhaust comes off the\nmanifolds where it meets a pair of Turbo mufflers, then up and over\nthe rear axle to exit in downward facing tailpipes before the rear\nvalance. Coil springs are found up front on the independent\nsuspension while a mono leaf spring is found in the back. We note\nsome residual oil on the oil pan, a drop on the flywheel cover, and\na couple of drops on the transmission pan.\nDrive-Ability\nNo battles here as the car started right up and the exhaust sang a\nwonderful tune! The very simple interior and good visibility makes\nthese cars a joy to drive and the powerful 350 cubes is more than\nadequate. The car turns, stops, and accelerates like a champ and\neverything works. The beauty of crank windows, for example, is that\nthey rarely fail!\nThere's just something about the hidden headlights of an RS that\nmakes it special. It changes the attitude of the car from a mild\nmannered pony car to a savvy cowboy with an ace up his sleeve and\nwearing his Stetson hat low over his eyes.

        "1969 COPO Camaro - Jerry MacNeish certified\nThis 1969 427, 4 speed, COPO Camaro was sold brand new, in 1969, to Mrs Arnold as a present to her son David, who's entire plan for the car was to go drag racing. It was purchased through Hayes Chevrolet-Buick in New Milford, CT on the 16th of Sept. 1969.\nSince then, the car has racked up just over 800 miles, nearly all of them at the long defunct Dover Drag Strip in Wingsdale, NY, just over the border from his home.\nThe story doesn't end there though. Seems as though the 17 year old Mr. Arnold ran in a bunch of races and won each one... Then, he lost one... The car needed to be better, so the original iron block 427 was sold and replaced with an all aluminum, 427, tunnel rammed, dual quad race engine, the entire steel front clip was removed and replaced with fiberglass fenders & hood . He also flared out the rear wheel wells so he could fit slicks and then painted the car in the typical 70's era metallic paint banners, with eagles and American flags, and he went back racing.\nReports are he did this for just a couple more years and then sold the aluminum 427 and parked the car. It sat for a couple years when a neighbor bought the car so he could get the steel front clip that came with the car, the car was then sold on to another person in CT. The third owner didn't keep it very long before he sold it the 4th owner, who tucked it away and that is where it sat for over 30 years when the current owner bought her.\nThe current owner was looking to build a big block 69 Camaro, 4 speed car so he could cruise around and go to local shows, cars and coffees, etc.\nThe original blue interior was still with the car and in near mint condition, so he used that but had to install new carpets, steering wheel and gauge console. The rear quarters were repaired to get back to stock and new sheetmetal fenders and hood were sourced. The original inner fenders were still with the car as well so those were cleaned up and used. The car was repainted in the original Dusk Blue Metallic, with the white hood/trunk stripes, a running 396 was dropped in and he started cruising around.\nHe posted several before and after photos up on the internet and several locals who knew the Arnolds and the car said, \"Hey, I think that is a COPO car.\"\nThe current owner started to do some research and he found he was correct after checking the VIN against the various sources and finding it there. This is a 9561 car and is verified with it's VIN listing on the Yenko Supercar Registry.\nHe phoned up COPO and Camaro specialist, Jerry MacNeish and he recently came out and did his certification. See photos showing Jerry's comments that this is a very clean, COPO Camaro, with many original parts and some not, due to the race history.\nNot wanting to strip the car down and repaint it without the stripes, he did know of a date correct , 512 coded iron block 427, which he purchased, rebuilt and installed.\nWhat is on offer is a 1969, 427, 4 speed , real, deal COPO Camaro, with less than 900 miles on the odometer.\nMore particulars about the car: From the firewall back is the original metal (aside from minor quarter panel repair), the interior is original, all the glass is original, the bumpers and trim are original, the dash is original (it still has the cut out in the speaker screen where the cable drive tach was installed), the rear bumper is in great condition and has some push truck marks in it and the push button starter and cut off switch holes are still in the lower left dash panel. The radiator is original (when he dropped the race engine in Mr. Arnold had the radiator neck changed for better flow) and rad. support is also original along with \"frame rails\", front A arms, and calipers; The 113 and 114 motor mounts are also original. New springs, front and rear, were installed. The original rear springs come with the car but had been modified for racing. The original trunk lid and the spoiler that the kid ran (still wearing it's metal flake American flag paint) come with the car too.\nHaving just finished the rebuild this car is in near perfect condition. There is no rust nor was there ever, she spent most of her life in garages. She starts, runs and drives beautifully.\nThe 427 iron block is attached to an M20 close ratio 4 speed and out to a date correct 12 bolt rear now running 3:73 gears and a limited slip, the original BE 12 bolt was twisted up beyond repair (the current owner did track down the original rear end and tried to buy it but for whatever reason the person wouldn't sell it to him). The tires are BFG Radial T/A's (2021 date code) in 235/70/R15 wrapped around rally wheels sprayed in the same Dusk Blue with just the center cap.\nThe car has power brakes as the only real amenity.\nEverything works, lights, horn, wipers, heat, blinkers.\nThe car is practically brand new and the mileage of 828 miles is correct.\nThis is a kick ass 427, 4 speed Camaro, with a kick ass story, that is also a real, deal COPO car.\nWith the current market for 100% original COPO cars over a quarter million dollars, this newly restored, 427, 4 speed, COPO Camaro is offered at only $115,000.\nAny questions, to schedule a time to inspect her, or to make an offer, please don't hesitate to contact me.\nThank you for the interest!\nAny questions, for several hundred more photos and video, to schedule a time to inspect her, or to make an offer, please don't hesitate to contact me.\nThank you for the interest!",

        "1967 Chevrolet Camaro Z28\nThe 1967 Camaro Z/28 was a purpose built race car, meant to face\noff against rivals in the SCCA Trans-Am series. This car has a lot\nto like about it. A unique emblem, thick racing stripes, and an\nexclusive non-convertible model, show this car means business.\nThough eventually tested with independent rear suspension, it was\nleft a rear leaf sprung car, with a heavy duty F41 suspension. It\nalso had upgraded power front disc brakes, and cold-air induction\nplenum cooling. A four-speed manual Muncie M21 transmission was the\nonly way to have it. The real star of the show, however, was the\nsmall block 302 engine under the hood! Developed between the 283\nand 327, to meet the SCCA regulations for the Trans-Am circuit,\nthis engine is special. Officially rated at 290 horsepower and\nmatching pound-feet of torque, the engine really put out 375\nhorsepower! Power came on strong throughout the power band, from\n3,500 to 6,500 rpm, and still pulled as high as 7,000! This may\nhave not been great for the street, having to carry high revs\nconstantly or downshift, but it was perfect for road racing. This\nway the engine could handle constant high revs. The car kept\nimproving from 1968 to 1969, the last year of the first generation,\nthrough constant tweaks and tinkering. Most probably have heard of\nFord's Mustang Boss 302, but might not realize Chevy had their own\n302, until now. Coded internally as \"the Cheetah,\" the Z/28 package\nbecame an instant legend.\nNow offered for consignment, this 1 of 602 1967 Chevrolet Camaro\nZ28 that as we can see has undergone a recent restoration that\nstays true to it's roots. Finished in the factory correct Mountain\nGreen, approximately 3% of the production was drenched in this hue\nand coming with its NCRS shipper paperwork and the correct\ndrivetrain. This particular car is also equipped with Soft-Ray\ntinted glass, power front disc brakes and the correct right side\nonly traction bar. It's time to get our groove on first gen Z28\nstyle.\nExterior\nA factory correct Mountain Green respray now appearing as base and\nclear coats and it shines like a crazy diamond. Very nice paint,\ncomplete with the glossy black up and over the hood stripe that\nskips the roof and picks back up again on the short deck lid putsus\nright in pony car heaven. This car can easily be mistaken for a run\nof the mill base model Camaro with its lack of spoilers,\nsimpleblacked out egg crate grille and single exposed headlights to\nlead the way. However, that allchanges when the green light comes\non and all the competitors can see if the tail end pulling away.\nRocker chrome, and wheel well surround trim is excellent, as are\nthe gaps and the expertly applied black pinstriping that follows\nthe contours of the upper beltline. Small bumpers are also\nexcellent. On all 4 corners are 15-inch Chevrolet Rally wheels with\ndog dish caps, wrapped by 7.75-15 red stripe tires, correct for the\nperiod but updated. Just pure Camaro bliss!\nInterior\nI'm breaking protocol and starting with the trunk which you have to\nsee to believe. All wrapped in gray and black houndstooth vinyl it\ncontains the spare, (wrapped in the houndstooth vinyl), a factory\njack, and crowbar neatly displayed within the houndstooth. Now we\ncan move to the meat and potatoes of the interior...the passenger\ncompartment. Swinging the doors, we are greeted with excellence.\nExcellent door panels in black, excellent buckets in black vinyl\nwith some snazzy tuck and roll inserts and smooth black bolsters\nare flanking the carpeted center hump. This carpet allows the\nchrome handledMuncie shifter to grow up and outward,easily within\nthe driver's reach. As we move to the dash,its all factory and all\nunassuming. There are a few chromed knobs and dual deep dish round\ngauges framed by an original steering wheel, all just in peachy\ncondition, (actually they are black). Beautiful carpet below, and a\ntight headliner above and we have covered the interior.\nDrivetrain\nTake a deep breath, here we go! The original numbers matching block\nstill rests in the engine bay between the fenders and looks just\nfab in its coating of Chevrolet engine orange. The numbers are all\nthere, however, the partial VIN stamping on the block presents as\nslightly suspect with multiple stampings done for a few of the\ndigits. Beyond that, things are correct for the casting number and\ndate as well as the stamping code. The correct starter, alternator\nand distributor are on and the date and part # correct Holley\n4-barrel carb feeds air and fossils through the correct Winters\naluminum intake. Bolted to the back is the numbers matching Muncie\nM21 4-speed manual transmission and in the back is the correct PJ\nstamped 12 bolt 3.73 Positraction rear axle.\nUndercarriage\nVisually edible, (aka eye candy), near perfect, and well taken care\nof on any rust fronts because it does not exist...anywhere! Solid\nas a rock. Front disc and rear drum, both power assisted are\ninstalled and we note an independent coil sprung front suspension\nand mono-leaf and single right side traction bar for the rear.\nChambered dual exhaust is noted for the mighty small\nblock'sexhale.\nDrive-Ability\nLights quickly, and just listening to the exhaust sound of the\nidle, you know you are in for a ride. This car does not disappoint,\nas it runs like a deer, stings like a bee, and handles like a\nbutterfly, all while looking great and turning heads. It has to be\na female car, because it can do more than one thing at once...but I\ndigress, and back to the wonderful handling, ride, and\nacceleration.

        "Ultra rare Motion Performance 427, 1/4 mile record holder and it\ntook a bullet from the police after a street race! It has lived a\nwild past. Today it is a meticulously restored, heavily documented\npiece of muscle car history.\nHistory: Barry Maskery worked for GM and participated in the\nR&D of the Mark IV big block engine. Barry wanted a 427 and it\nwas unavailable even to him, so he ordered this L-78 396-375 hp SS\nCamaro with a Rock Crusher 4-speed and a 4.88 posi. He then drove\nit to Motion Engineering and had it upgraded with a 427-425 hp long\nblock. He stayed at his aunt's house nearby while the car was being\nmodified. Barry went on to race it on a regular basis and the car\nearned a reputation of being a street bruiser. On May 9th, 1969,\nBarry set a track record of 10.45! (We have a copy of the\ncertificate) That's fast, even by today's standards. On July 4th,\n1976, Barry won King of the Hill in the very competitive Bracket 1\nracing. (We have newspaper article). Barry is alive and well, we\nhave contact with him.\nThe 2nd owner won a lot of money racing on the street. He recalls\none night beating a 1970 Hemi Cuda and the police set up a blockade\nat the end of the street. The Cuda stopped, but he blew past the\nblockade in the Camaro and the cops tried shooting his tires and\nbullet went through the 1/4 panel!\nMore recently the car went through a nut and bolt rotisserie\nrestoration to new condition. This rare piece of muscle car history\ncould be the center piece of any collection!\nEXTERIOR: The fit and finish is amazing. The sheet metal is\nperfectly aligned and straight. It has the fiberglass stinger hood\nand spoilers. Repainted its original Tuxedo Black without a vinyl\ntop. The finish is better than the day it left the factory. Every\npiece of chrome and trim has been restored or replaced, it has\noptional bumper guards. Every weather strip and seal has been\nreplaced; glass is crystal clear. Correct T-3 headlights. It's\nsitting on a set of chrome 15 inch Cragers, obviously wider in back\nand they're wearing Mickey Thompson tires.\nINTERIOR: Restored like brand new and it a factory born deluxe\ninterior with factory gauges, console, tilt wheel and an extremely\nrare AM-FM multiplex stereo system. A deluxe interior includes\nmolded door panels, upgraded upholstery, wood grain trim and trim\naround the pedals. It also has a vintage Stewart Warner oil\npressure gauge below the dash. From carpet to headliner, it is in\nexcellent condition.\nENGINE COMPARTMENT: The car was ordered with the biggest engine\npossible: 396-375 hp L-78. It was then taken to Motion Engineering\nfor the 427 long block upgrade which makes 425 hp. It is an\nauthentic, properly dated CE block. Original square port heads and\nmatched GM aluminum intake, correct Holley dual feed carburetor and\nit is dressed in Motion valve covers. Completely rebuilt and Dyno\ntuned, a spec sheet is included. Factory spec Crane solid lifter\ncam, roller timing chain and a set of headers. Correct 4 core\nradiator, reproduction hoses and clamps. Proper deep groove\npulleys. Delco battery topper and spring clamp cables. It is\ndetailed to authentic condition.\nTRUNK COMPARTMENT: Under the trunk lid and the jamb is painted\ngloss black. Inside is perfectly clean metal with a neat spatter\nfinish. It is complete with a restored rim, reproduction red line\ntire and complete jack assembly. The trunk mat and weather strip\nwere replaced. It also has optional trunk lamp.\nUNDERSIDE: Body off frame restored, every component was removed.\nRust free, clean floors were painted a smooth satin black.\nEverything was put back together with new or rebuilt authentic\nparts. All the steering and suspension was redone, it even has\ncorrect spiral shocks. The entire brake system was redone, disc in\nfront and drum in back. Replaced lines, e-brake cables etc. Fuel\nsystem was replaced. It was upgraded with a fatter exhaust, h-pipe\nand Flowmaster mufflers. Looking up at the motor it's clean Chevy\norange with a correct starter. Correct M-22 \"rock crusher\" Muncie\n4-speed with a Hurst linkage. Correct 12 bolt rear with special\nordered 4.88 gears! Obviously, gas mileage was not the goal.\nSERVICE: We inspected the car and replaced a few bulbs, lubed the\nspeedometer cable and replaced the trunk lid springs.\nMotion Camaros are extremely rare and very difficult to document.\nThis is one of the best documented examples in existence.

        "1969 Chevrolet Camaro - Pro Touring\nThe Camaro first debuted by Chevrolet in 1966 for the 1967 model\nyear. The intention was to compete directly with the Ford Mustang\nduring the popular muscle car/pony car era. They had the Corvair\nbut felt it would fail to keep up with Fords runaway success in the\nmarket. The were produced for 4 distinct generations before the\nname was dropped in 2002. That wasn't the end for the Camaro though\nbecause the name was revived for a concept car in 2009 that would\ngo on to be the 5th generation. This clean 1969 Camaro was the last\nyear for the 1st gen cars and has been very nicely restored in a\npro touring style. It has been set up to handle anything you throw\nat it. The body is painted in a Metallic Blue paint that really\npops out in the sun. The chrome and stainless trim has a nice shine\nand is all cleanly mounted in place. The car wears both a front and\nrear spoiler and a 2 inch cowl hood for that classic muscle car\nside profile. The glass is all in good condition throughout and is\nslightly tinted. All of the exterior lights are working properly\nwith no issues. The gas filler on these cars was originally located\nbehind the license plate but this one has been rerouted to fill via\na custom chrome locking cap on the rear taillight panel. The car\nhas a great stance and rides on 17 inch Billet Specialties wheels\nwith Nitto tires.\nIf the exterior wasn't enough to grab your attention just wait\nuntil you pop the hood. This classic Camaro is sporting a freshly\nbuilt LS7 V8 motor that has less than 1,000 miles on it since being\ninstalled. It cranks out 700 horsepower and dyno sheets can be\nprovided on request. The engine bay has a show ready appearance\nwith chrome and billet components everywhere you look. The engine\nruns great and has been fitted with a FiTech EFI system. It sounds\ngreat too through the ceramic coated Hooker headers into stainless\nsteel 2.5 inch dual exhaust. Keeping it running nice and cool is an\naluminum radiator with electric fan, transmission cooler with\nelectric fan, cool flex hoses, and even an oil cooler. Whether its\nroad courses, short cruises, or long distance driving this car can\ndo it all. It has a Detroit Speed suspension set up, Global West\nupper control arms and also Detroit Speed mini tubs in the rear.\nThe brakes are power and all 14 inch drilled/slotted discs with\nBaer calipers. It has power rack & pinion steering as well making\nit a very comfortable driver. The transmission is a 4L80E automatic\nwith stall converter that transfers all that power back to the\nmodified Ford 9 inch positraction rear end with Moser axles. Other\nvery nice upgrades include the Detroit Speed 18 gallon fuel tank\nand the Optima Red top battery that has been relocated into the\ntrunk in billet mounts.\nThe interior has been entirely redone in Black and it is clear it\nhas been very well maintained since completion. It has dual high\nback bucket seats with headrests up front and the upholstery\nthroughout looks great. It has the factory style center console\nwith horseshoe shifter but it has been modified with power window\ncontrols. It has a very high end stereo system which includes a\ncustom Autosound receiver with CD changer, RE audio speakers, a\nKicker ZX700-5 amplifier and a Cadence 10 inch subwoofer. Often a\nforgotten component on these classics is an Alarm system which this\none does have in place and also incorporates a remote start. The\ndash is all painted in a nice gloss Black and topped off with Pro\nComp Ultra-Lite gauges in billet bezels which also includes the\ndash mounted tachometer. It has nice Billet AC/Heat controls and\nthe AC blows cold. In front of the driver sits a nice custom Billet\n3 spoke steering wheel wrapped in Black leather.\nThis is one cool Camaro that someone is going to have a ton of fun\nwith behind the wheel. The drivetrain was expertly constructed with\nall the best components out there and with only 1,000 miles on the\nengine is sure to be good to go for many many years to come.\nPark this pro-touring classic in your garage for $109,500.00!\nMAJOR REDUCTION DOWN TO $79,900.00!",

        "1972 Chevrolet Camaro Coupe\nEveryone oohs and ahhhhh over the first gen Camaro and rightfully\nso. It is definitely a classic and collectable. However if you want\nto get in on the rising curve of the collectable market, you should\nseriously look into the 2nd generation of the Camaro. It has great\nlines, a V grille and headlights within the quarters that give it a\nnewer look. Scoring an RS or SS version can be tricky and you need\nto watch the market. Here at CAM, you never know what is coming\nthrough the door, adding to the suspense. Await no longer, a\nrigging value collectable just drove through our intake door, and\nis now available.\nFor consignment, an anomaly, a rarity, something you just don't see\nevery day...a 1972 Camaro with a mere 15,835 title verified actual\nmiles. Stated to be all original by our consignor with a snappy\nnumbers matching 350ci V8, Flame Orange paint, a basic black vinyl\ninterior, a 3 speed manual, and 14-inch steel wheels with factory\ncovers, you will be able to parade up Main Street while in the back\nof your mind you will be making money. An investment in the future\nif you will.\nExterior\nBathed in the consignor stated originalFlame Orange paint this\nmorsel of low hanging fruit remains extra juicy. However, after\nsome examination we have determined the paint to be a respray due\nto some sanding scratches in the finish and overspray on both door\nstrikers. This aside, the rest of the car has plenty of spit shine\nleft on the steel. The exterior gaps are good, and the panels\nremain straight. Starting up front with an egg crate V front\ngrille, single headlights and ovoid parking/signal lighting tucked\ninto the roll pan just below. Thefull length front bumper and its\nguards are mirror-like, and all trim remains very nicely preserved.\nStarting in 1970, began the years when GM began to change the\ndesign of the Camaro, and blurred the lines between a Camaro and a\nPontiac, give a gaze to the front of the car and it will pan out!\nNot a true \"beak\" but certainly features that resemble each other.\nNice window trimmings frame the front and rear glass and a thin\nstrip of stainless highlights the base of the door windows. The\nback of the car lowers in a gentle slope and ends by dropping off\nto the rear of the car. Think base model...no stripes, no\nspoilers...just pure Camaro. Bringing up the rear of the car are\ndual round tail lights and a solid bumper with a dip in the center\nto frame the bottom of the license plate. A thin stainless and\nblack rubber strip runs mid beltline between the wheel houses and\nhovers above a Camaro 350 script and polished rocker moldings.\n14-inch standard steel wheels with factory wheel covers are wrapped\nin Hankook radials all from 2022. No runs, no drips, or errors on\nthis beauty.\nInterior\nA swing of the doors is akin to a small time travel jaunt allowing\nus to breathe in the consignor stated originality. The black\ntextured background around the round sunken in gauges are\nimmaculate, and a padded black dash top frames the top. We note the\nsurround may be a replacementas it has no provision for the rear\nwindow defogger that is seen on the rear package tray. Moving to\nthe center we note the factory AM radio and above are two air\nconditioning and heating vents molded into the dash. For the\npassenger, an under the dash glove box with a shiny Camaro badge.\nOn the carpeted hump between 2 high back buckets covered in vinyl\nwith integral headrests is the standard 3-speed floor shifter. The\ndoors use a similar vinyl pattern too, and look like they came\nright off the factory floor. Black carpeting covers the floors, and\na rear bench, also pristine, occupies the back of the interior,\nallowing extra guests to experience the thrill ride. A tight black\nheadliner is above and a shout to the trunk with its factory\napplied splatter paint and original spare.\nDrivetrain\nUnder the hood in a nicely detailed but lightly patined black\npainted engine bay is the original 350ci V8. This mill is numbers\nmatching, is fed by a single 2-barrel carburetor and is capable of\nproducing 165hp. Bolted to the back is a numbers matchingSaginaw\n3-speed manual transmission that sends power to spin the rear tires\nvia a GX stamped 10 bolt, 3.08 gear rear axle. All well preserved\nand looking exactly the part of a 15,000 mile car.\nUndercarriage\nIndependent coil springs for the front and for the rear leaf\nsprings. Front disc brakes for this one, and rear drums slow it for\nthe woah. A mix of black undercoating, surface rust and factory\nFlame Orange paint coats the bottom side of this second generation\nMustang killer. Breathe deep, now exhale through the stock\nreplacement single exhaust. Woosh...hold on to the Jesus bar.\nDrive-Ability\nYes! Yes! Yes! It definitely drives, it certainly starts, and it\noffers up plenty of smiles aswe were driving a51 year old almost\nnew car. Climbing in is quite easy, even for this 63 year young\nwriter, and once in it is comfortable, and all is working well.\nDefinitely an E-ticket ride for this one with nearly no rattles,\nand all functions operational save for the radio not broadcasting,\na noticeable vacuum leak from under the dash, and of course no\ntoggle to actuate the rear defogger. Oh and did I mention, the AC\neven blows cold.\nAt first glance an original 1972 style Camaro nearly looks pliable,\na true grocery getter. But if we dig deeper, there is tons of\nhistory in the low low miles and thoughtful care over the years.\nCars of this nature were mostly used up, then passed on to\nteenagers who drove them into the ground or worse.

        "383 STROKER V8, 700R4 OVERDRIVE, COLD A/C, POWER STEER & BRAKES, QUALITY BUILD!\nA couple years back, the 1969 Camaro was named the most significant Chevrolet of the past 100 years, and when you look at this recently restored (only 749 miles since the build!), electric blue 1969 Chevrolet Camaro RS/SS Restomod, it's pretty easy to figure out why. Meticulously restored to a show-worthy level and featuring a thumping, fuel-injected 383 V8 Stroker mated to a smooth-shifting 700R4 automatic, a beefed-up performance suspension, a host of choice options, and a beautifully appointed A/C interior, this is the '69 Camaro that's been haunting your dreams. Isn't it time you woke up and smelled the high-test?\nThe vivid Dark Blue Metallic paint is the first thing that grabs you about this car, a show-stopping finish that's bound to keep winning trophies (it recently won NSRA's Pro Pick Prize) on its own merit, regardless of the competition level. A custom blend of modern basecoat/clearcoat urethane laid down with an expert's precision, the top-notch paint and bodywork is incredibly well-executed and shows the result of countless hours of labor-intensive ministrations, on full display in that miles-deep, high-gloss, and distortion-free surface. We won't call it perfect, simply because nothing in this world is and a subjective observer is bound to find a minor imperfection or two, but rest assured that this beauty looks even better in person than it does in our pictures. And we love that they decided to forgo any stripes or decals, instead letting that magnificent ocean of metallic blue do all the talking. Regardless of whether it was born as a real RS, all the desirable performance details are there, from the aggressive lower front valance decked out with oval fog lights and a chin spoiler, the blacked-out grille and Detroit Speed electric hideaway headlights just above it, to the cowl induction hood and matching ducktail spoiler out back \u2013 so it has a KILLER performance look that let's everyone know it's not some ordinary Sunday cruiser. Chrome bumpers fore and aft sparkle marvelously against the blue paint and provide just enough contrast to appease the artist in all of us, joined by the polished brightwork around the wheel arches, lining the rocker panels, and surrounding all the lights and glass. If you ever wondered what a full-blown, six-figure, nut-and-bolt restoration gets you, well, you're currently drooling over it.\nInside, the restored black interior is very nicely appointed and features high-back buckets wrapped in fresh vinyl upholstery, a matching rear seat, and super-clean door panels at the flanks. A three-spoke wood-rimmed wheel on a tilt column is a nice representation of the original and makes things a lot more comfortable at the head of the cockpit. Upgraded Dakota Digital gauges were swapped into the instrument panel to keep an accurate accounting of the upgraded drivetrain, which is exactly what you want when you're dealing with ample horsepower at the ready. A factory center console splits the middle of the cabin and houses a fan-favorite horseshoe shifter that manages the gears, and the Rally-Pac style gauges at the helm of it are all Dakota Digital units as well. A full Vintage Air A/C unit blows ice-cold R134a-treated air into the cabin, and a retro-style, hands-free AM/FM/AUX head unit plays tunes through upgraded speakers in the kick panels, rear package tray, and a booming Kicker subwoofer in the trunk. The rear seat looks untouched, the headliner is taut, the door panels are slick, and the carpets are plush and tie the entire interior together.\nThat's a powerful, pro-built 383 cubic inch V8 stroker motor under the hood that ostensibly puts big block power in a small block package. With big horsepower to the rear wheels and enough torque to groove the asphalt, it's definitely has the firepower to match its killer looks. Many enthusiasts prefer the small block cars for their superior handling and nimble demeanor, and this Camaro is no exception. Augmented with a hydraulic roller camshaft, hydraulic roller lifters, roller-rocker arms, 10:1 compression forged pistons, aluminum heads, and topped with an Edelbrock aluminum intake and Holley Sniper Fuel-Injection system, it breathes easy and delivers quick power up and down the throttle. It's beautifully finished with Chevrolet orange paint on the block, Chevrolet valve covers, and matching air cleaner up top, all of which really pop from outside the blacked-out engine bay. An HEI ignition fires it all up, long-tube headers dump into a terrific-sounding X-pipe dual exhaust system with throaty Magnaflow mufflers, and a giant aluminum radiator keeps the whole show nice and cool. The 700R4 4-speed automatic transmission is the perfect dance partner to the feisty small block, which is further tamed with a 3500-stall torque convertor inside, and it spins a heavy-duty Fab 9-inch rear end. Power steering and power front and rear Wilwood discs round out this car's list of noteworthy attributes, and staggered Billet Specialties wheels wrapped in 225/45/18 front and 285/40/18 Nitto performance radials keep this beauty planted to the ground.\nIf you haven't experienced the greatest Chevy of all time, this is an ideal opportunity to do so, and if your goal is fun, then few cars will deliver more smiles-for-miles than this frame-off restored '69.

        "If you set out to build the ultimate 1969 Camaro, what would it\nlook like? One of the best colors from that year (Cortez Silver)?\nCheck. Big motor? You betcha. 4-speed gearbox? Oh, heck yes!\nDialed-in interior? Got it! Over-the-top build quality? But of\ncourse! Well, forget about building it yourself, here it is,\nalready finished and ready to go at a price way below the cost of\nconstruction. This 1969 Chevrolet Camaro SS checks all the right\nboxes, and with huge power and a recent restoration, its dominating\nways are just beginning.\nSeriously, if you could have a vintage Camaro built any way you\nwanted, isn't this pretty much what you'd wish for? The paint and\nbodywork is in great shape, the curb appeal is through the roof,\nand there's no mistaking that fantastic 1969 Camaro profile. When\nit came down to restore this beauty, the builders were wise to\nstick with the original script. It's obvious this was a very solid,\ndesert flower to begin with, but nevertheless it was torn down, set\nstraight, and then coated with layer after layer of factory-correct\nCode 69 Cortez Silver paint. Every component that wasn't up to the\nbuilder's high standards was either restored or replaced with a\nfresh one, and the guys doing the work were obviously very, very\ngood at their jobs. The Cortex Silver paint is fresh, with only\nminor imperfections to speak of, and although it was built as a\ndriver they certainly didn't shy away from making it look awesome\nin person. There's not much to complain about on tis slick, smooth,\nand uniform surface, and the painted-on black \"hockey-stick\"\nstripes and correct black vinyl roof add the perfect contrast to\nthe silver finish. A front chin spoiler, blacked-out SS-grille,\nSS-style hood complete with chrome vents, chrome fender \"gills\",\nand a ducktail spoiler all add to the car's menacing look, but\nthanks to high-quality restoration work that stuck to the factory\nscript, it's not at all over-the-top. It shows some incredibly\nsmall signs of use and age today, nothing that can be seen easily,\nbut that means you can take it out and have some fun without\nworrying about hurting a priceless paint job. Chrome bumpers fore\nand aft, wheel arch and rocker panel trim, and window/door hardware\nall add bright bling, meaning this F-Body absolutely glistens under\nthe sun. If you're looking for a super-clean '69 Camaro, you'd be\nhard-pressed to find another as dialed-in as this beauty.\nThe Code 715 Blue standard interior is mostly stock, although with\nthe help of newer materials and a couple choice upgrades, the cabin\nis in excellent condition. Top quality vinyl seat covers on the\nfront buckets and rear seat are virtually flawless, while the\nfactory center console is terrific option that barely looks touched\nas well, and with matching blue door panels at the flanks, a taut\nblue headliner above, and plush blue carpets on the floors, the\ncabin feels sporty, tidy, and very complete. Against the Cortex\nSilver paint the cabin really looks good, and despite a couple\nupgrades there's nothing in there that seems overly modern or out\nof place. Everything's been restored, of course, and they spent the\nlong dollar on the best parts money could buy. A blue carpeted mat\nprotects the blue dash underneath (and yes, the dashboard is free\nof any cracks or blemishes), blue floormats protect the clean\ncarpets, and woodgrain trim adorning the center console and dash\nreally warms things up inside. The stock gauges are still in place,\nalthough with all that added power the builders smartly added a\ntachometer strapped to the steering column, along with a trio of\naftermarket auxiliary gauges to keep a closer eye on the organized\nviolence underneath the hood. The woodrimmed three-spoke steering\nwheel and cue-ball topped Hurst 4-speed shifter is a timeless\ncombination that'll never go out of style, and although by all\naccounts this appears to be a factory A/C car, only the vents and\nfactory controls remain. Options include an upgraded retro-sound\nAM/FM/Cassette stereo, a working heater/defrost unit, and seatbelts\nfore and aft. And out back, there's a neatly finished trunk\ncomplete with correct plaid mats and a spare tire and jack set for\nemergencies.\nThe great thing about '69 Camaros is that upgraded motors slide\nright in and hook right up. The potent-looking small block found\nhere is a professionally built, bored and stroked 427 \"Fat Mouse\"\nV8 that's been Dyno'd at 413HP and 429 lb-ft of torque, and it fits\nright at home in the F-body engine bay where practically every\nsingle component is dedicated to making it go faster. The long list\nof upgrades inside the block include Dart heads, Eagle connecting\nrods, a Callie's Compstar crankshaft, a big Comp Cams camshaft,\nComp Cams pushrods, roller lifters, a roller timing set, Mahle\npistons and rings, and a performance coated bearings that all work\ntogether to deliver huge power in a big way. Augmented with a giant\nHolley 4-barrel carburetor atop a Dart air-gap intake, an MSD\nignition, long-tube headers, and a giant Griffin aluminum radiator\nto keep it all nice and cool, it's obvious this Camaro was meant to\nbe driven, as the builder picked the best-of-the-best in\nperformance goodies. The transmission is a slick-shifting Muncie\nM21 4-speed gearbox feeding a beefy 12-bolt rear end that can\neasily handle the power, while the suspension's been upgraded with\naftermarket shocks and a front swaybar, while the power steering\nand power front disc brakes make driving that much more enjoyable.\nStock 15-inch SS Mag wheels add a period-perfect touch, especially\nwith those gorgeous Firestone F70-15 redlines that stuff the\nfenders.\nOffered with restoration photos, build receipts, and a Dyno sheet,\nthis '69 Camaro is a pro-built stunner that's only lacking one\nthing: a new owner.

        "1969 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 DZ302\nIn the world of muscle cars every manufacturer started introducing\ndifferent trim levels which combined mostly performance focused\noptions. For instance with Mustangs you had the Shelby GT 350 and\nGT 500. While there may be some cosmetic differences the main focus\nstuck with the overall muscle car theme of packing in as much\nperformance as possible for competitions. Chevrolet's entry onto\nthe field for its first generation of Camaros was the RS, SS and\nprimarily the Z28. The Z28 was designed specifically for the SCCA\nTrans Am Series. They designed the DZ 302 motor to come in under\nthe 305 ci limitation and these motors went on to reach legendary\nstatus. They achieved this by using a 327 ci block and a crankshaft\nfrom a 283 ci motor resulting in a 302.4 ci displacement. The\nprimary purpose was to compete with the Mustang and the cars went\non to perform very well in NHRS drag racing and the SCCA Trans Am\nseries where it claimed the 1968 and 1969 Manufacturer's\nChampionship title. This pleased the developers vision of being\nsuperior to the Mustang and these cars have become quite\ncollectable. Another unique thing about them was with the large\n4.00 in bore and short 3.00 in stroke the engine could rev well\ninto the 7,000 rpm range. This made the small blocks design much\nmore reliable than its big block counter part while allowing it\nhigher horsepower potential. This extremely clean 1969 Z28 is in\ngreat condition and is a date correct engine. The rebuilt motor\nruns extremely well and is paired with a 5 speed manual\ntransmission and 12 bolt rear end. The car does come with its\noriginal 4 speed. It has power brakes with discs up front and power\nsteering.\nThe body on this Camaro is very clean and painted in a nice combo\nof its original Cortez Silver with dual Black racing stripes.

        "1967 Chevrolet Camaro SS\nI bought this Camaro from a local dealership. The salesman told me things about the Camaro that I found out later (after I purchased it)was not true. I have talked to the owner of the dealership & to no prevail I was not able to get out of the deal.I got the truth from the owner of the dealership himself. The owner of the dealership is the one that bought the Camaro from the previous owner. If I knew the truth from the beginning I would not have bought the Camaro. So here's the truth. It is a real 1967 Camaro but it's a \"restomod\" SS. The VIN # is true to the Camaro except the SS 427 part.It was a rotisserie restoration in 1996. The previous owner turned the Camaro into a SS then. He put the 427 big block & a 12 bolt rear end.It has a 850 Holley double pumper carburetor. I don\u2019t know what the gears in the rear end are & I don\u2019t know what type of transmission it is. The mechanic at the dealership did fine tuning to make the Camaro run at it's peak. I have driven the Camaro several times. It runs strong & handles like new. I've been on the highway with it a couple of times & the Camaro is fast& rides smooth. No shaking or vibrations at high speed. I have receipts from the previous owner that was given to me at the time of sale. It's a great car I thought I bought a true SS. I'm being honest about what I know so you as the buyer know what your buying. My price is what I paid for the Camaro. I just want my money back. Price is firm.",

        "Rotisserie restored fully upgraded 1969 Camaro Z28. X33 code, Non\nRS, car with date Matching 12 Bolt I do not have the original\ndrivetrain, or a certification from McNiesh that this is a 'real Z'\nThis CA original no rust car has gone through a documented\nrestoration and build from a solid no-rust 'roller' and retains the\nstock appearance with modern upgrades to make it a very nice Daily\nDriver. The car is originally from Pasadena, CA and Great pains\nwere taken to make the car look period correct, sound right yet\nfeel like a modern car with all the reliability of an LS swap\nProTour. The build is documented on camaros.net under 'jethros\nburnished brown Z28'. The feel of this car is amazing as it has\nvery comfy and sporty Honda seats disguised in custom White 1969\nCamaro Vinyl. SpeedHutt Digital (analog face) GPS Speedo, Tach with\nbuilt in shift lights, and engine gauges give you the goods. The\ninterior is otherwise stock 1969 standard white vinyl recently\nredone with a kit from Classic industries in Huntington Beach.\nEvery nut and bolt has been touched (most upgraded to stainless) on\nthis car. It's a joy to drive and with this rare burnished brown\nexterior, white Z stripes and white interior - the looks and\ncomments are overwhelming. If you want to make this a more savage\nProTouring car, just add a set of new wheels with some larger tires\nand you're done - the car is built for the upgrade. The LS power in\nthis car is a handful when you get into it, so there's Wilwood\ndiscs at all 4's to keep you honest. This car is really special and\nit needs to be driven. Here's some more details on the 1969 Z28\nbuild:DriveTrain:Please Note The Following **Vehicle Location is at\nour clients home and Not In Cadillac, Michigan. **We do have a\nshowroom with about 25 cars that is by appointment only **Please\nCall First and talk to one of our reps at  EXT 1 **\n475hp LS1 engine: Stock bottom end with Texas Speed 228 cam and\nTexas Speed PRI 2.5 heads, Holley LS Swap Oil Pan Stainless\nHeaders, dual exhaust all the way out the back All new 2002\nF-body/Camaro LS1 engine accessories: Power steering, water pump,\nalternator, AC compressor etc. Transmission is a 6-speed Manual:\nBrand New \"T56 Magnum\" (warranty to 700hp),",

        "Probably one of the most original cars out there. Very Rare Ermine white with blue deluxe interior. Blue convertible top and boot. Chevy 327 engine with matching numbers. Front disc and rear drum brakes. One of the few made with deluxe interior and remote drivers side exterior mirror. Want to really know what has happened to this car? Check out the TV show \"Garage Squad\", Season one, episode 7. Yes, it is this car! This car was on that show and you can see what was done to it!\nI believe it to have the original top, original interior, original rug, etc. Original deluxe seat belts. According to NCRS car was born January 11,1968. This explains why some belts indicate a 1967 date. The list goes on. The changes that were made to this very original convertible can be seen on that TV show but include: MSD electronic ignition and fuel injection, headers, new suspension, new magna-flow exhaust, rebuilt original engine from cam shaft up, new wheels and rims.Vehicle has original AM radio with the added 1960ish FM converter and it works. I cant think of anything that doesn't work. Wipers, all lights, directionals, window washer, horn, gauges, high beams, all in working condition. Original power top in good condition.\nOK its 50 years old, so whats wrong with it? Interior is great except arm rests, see pictures. But then again, its a convertible with original interior. Light bulbs for radio need replacement. I have original gas cap but replaced it with locking camaro cap. I have what I believe to be original starter but replaced it just recently. I have original trunk mat but replaced it with a newer one. Very little surface rust and strong body and frame.\nCar was previously owned by the same person for 22 years and obviously well taken care of. I'm going to make an educated guess that it has about 3000 miles on it since its debut on the TV show, and honestly I put on 2000 of them. Its so much fun to drive.\nExterior looks great. Bumpers are clean and rust free. All chrome moldings are in great shape. Exterior paint appears to have been redone about 20 years ago. It is the original color and interior. Vin number and body numbers match the car and its colors and accessories.Engine runs great and sounds strong.\nI went to one Car show this year and it won \"Best Camaro\" at the 2018 Classics by the Sea Scenic Car Show. Its not absolutely perfect, it has some small imperfections. But its a looker and a MOVIE STAR!",
