The center console in between\nthe bucket seats is in very nice shape; better than most I've\nseen.\nENGINE COMPARTMENT: The detailed engine compartment has the correct\n1968 440 Magnum engine. Appears to be stock: valve covers, air\ncleaner, manifolds etc. It's also a factory air conditioning car,\nand that has just been serviced. It has a Mopar radiator with the\nproper shroud fan and cap. It also has reproduction clamps on the\nhoses and the windshield squirters are hooked up. The engine bay is\nclean and painted yellow.

It has a\nwide oval tire for a spare plus the jack assembly is there,\nincluding the lug wrench.

It also has a dual exhaust\nsystem with polished stainless steel Dynomax mufflers and the\ncorrect chrome tips. The fuel system has been replaced including\nthe tank and the lines. The brake system was completely rebuilt\nplus the e-brake is hooked up. Looking up the motor it is spotless\nand has 1968 casting codes on the side of the block plus the\nstarter was replaced. The 727 Torqueflite automatic transmission\nalso looks fresh. That transfers power to the 8 \ufffd\" rear end that's\nbeen totally apart and serviced.\nSERVICE: After our inspection of this car we secured the wiring\nunder the dash, installed a reverse light switch, repaired the\noriginal radio, fixed the dash lights, fixed the wipers, serviced\nthe air conditioning, replaced the heater valve, fixed the hood\nturn signal indicator, replaced the cigarette lighter, replaced the\nsteering gearbox, replaced the power steering pulley, repaired the\nloose vent window frame, replaced the window regulator, lubed the\nrear window tracks, freed the proportioning valve and bled the\nbrake system.\nI attend tons of shows and auctions and get offered hundreds of\ncars every month through our website and I can count on one hand\nhow many 1968 Chargers I've stumbled upon in the past year.

        "Features:\nCustom chassis\nDana 60 4:10 Gears\nWilwood brakes\n572 HEMI built by Nelson Racing Motors, CA\nTwin Turbo 40 PSI capable\nT56Magnum 6 Speed\nNo rust, new metal work\nThis 1969 Dodge Charger is inspired by RTR 68 Charger built by Johan Ericksson in Swedenpoweredbyjohanon Instagram and by th Maximus 68 Charger built by Tom Nelson at Nelson Racing Engines out of Chatsworth California.\nI chose Neil at B&N Hotrods in Maple Ridge, British Columbia, Canada because of their high quality of builds that I have seen. I knew they were to ones to build it because of their attention to detail in their builds. Having traveled to Utah to see Dave Kindig of KINDIG-It DESIGNS, also from the T V show Bitchin Rides, I knew I wanted more than just a Hotrod, I wanted a one of a kind Hotrod/Show car.\nEverything on this car is and will be custom, but it will still be a Dodge Charger at first glance, The heavy lifting work is done on the car with all the body metal work 90% finished and the metal work inside, ie: floors and so on being ready for final fit.There are a ton of parts for the car that come with it as I have purchased a lot and basically the car is at the stage of final assembly and Paint and interior.\nI realize for the car to get to the finish line and be what it is intended to be, I must allow someone else to get it to its final destination as probably one of the nicest chargers ever built. I would suggest getting the car completed by Neil and his crew at B&N Hotrods as he already has the vision to make this car what it should be. His contact info can be requested by any serious inquiries on the car.\nChassis\nThe body is sitting on an Art Morrison custom muscle car chassis, specially built by Morrison to handle the immense power this car will generate. With fully independent rear suspension which includes a Dana 60 with 4:10 gears. Rear brakes are 14.25\u201d- 4 piston Wilwood disks with Pirelli 405/25/R24 P zero tires on 24\u201dx 15\u201d Foose Knuckle Rims. The front suspension is Morrison\u2019s custom upper and lower control arms with ZR1 Corvette hub assembly and spindles, again with Wilwood 15\u201d- 6 piston discs with Pirelli 265/30/R22 P Zero tires on 22\u2019 X 9\u201d Foose Knuckle rims. This chassis set up is one of a kind and every detail has been considered for ultimate handling and ride performance.\nEngine\nTwin turbo 572 all Aluminum HEMI built by Nelson Racing Motors out of Chatsworth CA. Currently set up for break in tune at 1005 hp and 924 ft lbs torque at 6 psi of boost. Last dyno pull reached 1731 hp and 1494 ft lbs torque at 19 psi of boost. Engine is currently set up with four different tunes starting at 1005hp up to 1731hp, four separate tunes at the turn of a tune setting key. Engine is fully capable of 2500 \u2013 3000hp and max boost of 40 psi. Transmission is an American Power Train T56Magnum 6 speed manual with cryogenically hardened gears. In a conversation with Tom Nelson, he told me that this is the newest version of the 572 twin Turbo Hemi and has all the newest upgrades and modifications and in his words \u201cthe best Hemi he has built to date\u201d An upgrade from the motor in the 68 Charger called Maximus, built by Nelson Racing engines.\nEngine and transmission were installed by B & N Hotrods out of Maple Ridge, British Columbia, Canada. B & N has done all the work on the car to date and are doing amazing work with this car. Neil at B & N has spent time at Nelson Racing while the motor was on the dyno.\nRust Free\nThere is absolutely no rust on the car as it has a new and complete chassis. The body was stripped down to bare metal and all unsatisfactory body panels have been replaced, starting with the rear quarters, the corner caps which normally bolt on, have been properly welded on to the rear corners so there is no longer any seam for a smother look. The trunk lid has also been replaced with a new one. One door needed to be replaced as it was not up to quality standards as well as one front fender. The rockers on both sides are new. All flooring including the trunk is new custom fabrication from B & N Hotrods as required with the new chassis from Art Morrison. The metal work is of the highest quality workmanship and after four tours of the custom car builder Dave Kindig of the TV show Bitchin Rides shop, the work from B & N is on par with that same quality.",

        "1968 Dodge Charger RT Hardtop\n\"The only 1968 car which comes close to challenging the new Charger\nfor styling accolades is the new Corvette, which is remarkably\nsimilar to the Charger, particularly when viewed from the rear\nquarter. But, we give the honors to the Charger for several\nreasons. First, the Corvette, being a smaller car in both seating\ncapacity and wheelbase, has a much easier time attaining the\ndesired sporty image. Second, Dodge stylists have shown that they\ncan create a car in the current idiom with originality, combining\njust the right amount of tasteful conformity with that novelty and\nfreshness which attracts attention.\" From Car and Driver's review\nof a '68 Charger, published November, 1967.\nFor consignment, a 1968 Dodge Charger R/T hardtop, a highly\noptioned true J-code Hemi car in a metallic version of L-code\nMedium Dark Turquoise paint. 17,584 R/T models were built in 1968\nand added more than $400 to the price of a Charger, about $3,600 in\ntoday's money! But only 475 of them received the Hemi, just 0.5% of\nCharger production.\nExterior\nThe genius design of the Mopar B-body is properly expressed in this\ngeneration of Charger with its long body panels, flat horizontal\nplanes, sweeping C-pillar and the stupendous flying buttresses that\nflow off the rear window like tail of an F-15 jet. The one year\nonly tail treatment of the car screams muscle car and pulls in more\njet inference with quad tail lights that halo around dark holes in\nthe center on a textbook square rear fascia over dual exhaust tips\npositioned perfectly under the car. Body lines on the door suggest\nforward movement and they repeat on the hood with turn indicators\nbaked in. The hidden headlights flanking the vertical grille lack\nany disturbance of a midrib that would alter the '69 and '70 and\nthe front fenders sport one year circular side markers. Body keyed\n15-inch steel wheels are wrapped in red line tires and the vinyl\ntop is done in white which as we'll see, matches the interior.\nImperfections include a scuff on the left front fender, filler on\nthe right, minor scratches, minor bubbles, and some waviness or\ndepression to the vinyl top.\nInterior\nWhite vinyl door cards are topped with a header that is more ivory,\nunderscored by a polished trim piece over an armrest that shows\nsome patina on the driver's side. White bucket seats with sectional\npleats also wear head restraints which have a classic 60's design\nin their simplicity. Dorchester grained vinyl continues on the back\nwhere the seats, armrests, and horizontal surface of the sidewalls\nshow some patina. A brown plastic steering wheels tops a column\nthat tracks down to the dashboard which with off center gauges and\na combo clock/tachometer, (optional), on ribbed black plastic,\nwhile toggles for the vent controls are mounted on the bottom\nsurface of the dash pad, just over the optional Music Master AM\nradio. The ribbing theme continues on the center console and takes\non a more metallic profile and houses a curved chrome shifter with\nthumb button actuation. Black loop carpet covers the floor along\nwith some carpeted mats and the white perforated headliner holds\ntight to the shoulder belts clipped to the outside edges, and we\nnote some separation of the headliner back at the C-pillar.\nDrivetrain\nAll Hail! The non-original, but date correct 426ci Hemi V8 under\nthe hood, it all its gleaming goodness, rated at 425 horsepower and\nsucking fuel through dual 4-barrel carburetors. Miles per gallon?\nWho cares when you're counting smiles per gallon?! The bay is\nspotless and period correct, backed by a date correct A727\nTorqueflite 3-speed automatic transmission sending hundreds of\nhorses to the 8 \ufffd inch rear and 3.23 gears. Power brakes are needed\nto rein in those ponies and are configured as optional front discs\nand standard rear drums.\nUndercarriage\nVery clean underneath with surface rust appearing only on a section\nof frame where paint has been scraped and some suspicious brazing\non the outer rear of the left front unibody rail. A few drops of\noil on the pan but otherwise the underside is dry and free of\ndebris. The dual exhaust meets an H-pipe, (as in Hemi!), then to\nFlowMaster mufflers and finally to resonators in the back just\nbefore the squarish chrome tips put on a trumpet show out back.\nTorsion bar suspension is up front and leaf springs in the\nback.\nDrive-Ability\nAnother day, another legend here at Classic Auto Mall. The\nhemispherical beast lights up and lets out a roar, muted a bit by\nthose resonators, and we stealthily find our way onto the test\nloop. There's obvious power on hand and straight tracking and\nbraking is on point. Really no complaints here and all functional\nitems worked as expected. While Classic Auto Mall represents that\nthese functions were working at the time of our test drive, we\ncannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of\nyour purchase.\nWe have a red carpet at the entrance of Classic Auto Mall, pre\nrolled out for your arrival.

        "1970 Dodge Charger RT Tribute\n\"See the White Hat Special the Dodge Boys today, right here at\nClassic Auto Mall. Ads of the day touted \"Mother warned me that\nthere would be men like you driving cars like that. Do you really\nthink you can snag me with that long low touch machine you just\nrolled up in? Dodge Charger RT with some SE trimmings sounds like\nAlphabet soup, and frankly I'm attracted to you because you have a\nvery intelligent face...My name is Julia and here's my number!\"\nOffered for consignment and your viewing pleasure, showing 55,672\nnon verifiable miles, the epitome of what a Dodge muscle car from\n1970 should be: covered headlamps in an inset grille, the flying\nbuttress rear window treatment, swelling fenders on a two door\nplatform and power to match its visual presentation. That usually\nmeans a Hemi engine, but instead of the OEM 426 factory mill, this\ncar is equipped with a 472ci 575hp version topped with Indy\naluminum heads and ceramic polished headers with electric exhaust\ncutouts. Unlike the factory release, this engine is even equipped\nwith Vintage Air, power steering, power brakes, as well as MSD\nignition parts, serpentine belt front accessories and an aluminum\nradiator. That power is backed by an 18 spline A833 4-speed\ntransmission with overdrive. Inside is a Legendary SE level\ninterior appointment done in white materials, a center console with\nPistol Grip floor shift, wood grain trim, a Tic-Toc-Tach and 150\nMPH speedometer, 3 spoke sport steering wheel and R/T trim mats and\ndash logos. Outside, this car is covered in a variation of FJ5\nSublime by Michael's Custom Paint, with HEMI hood blackouts using\nsilver lettering, a white vinyl top, chrome exhaust tips, dual body\ncolor mirrors, R/T door scoops and emblems, and the white scat\nstripe around the rear. Riding on a set of 5 spoke styled road\nwheels and modern BF Goodrich Radial T/A tires, this Dodge Charger\nis ready for you to turn the key and smoke the competition on the\nshow field as well as at the stop light drags.\nExterior\nBumpers have been rechromed and all trim has been polished to look\nlike new, so on the bling side of this car we are fully covered.\nAll this is attached to straight steel panels all reworked to\nperfection then bathed in Sublime Green paint, which shows with\nnary a flaw. Also adorned with the original factory style sticker\nin white, the rear is wrapped with the wide white band and RT\ncallouts show their faces on the added door scoops. Large \"flying\nbuttress\" styled B pillars swoop rearward, framing the rear glass\nwhich tilts at a lesser angle than the pillars and give the back of\nthe roof the inset look. Upfront the correct hidden badged R/T\nheadlight panels are in a 3 segment grille with surrounding\ntrimmings and one of those shiny dipped bumpers below. A body\nmatching side view mirror hangs from either door, and on the\ndriver's side is a large hinged fill cap on the top of the rear\nquarter. Not to be left out is the expansive roof, now covered in a\nperfectly complimenting white vinyl roof. BF Goodrich supplies the\nrubber which wraps the Mopar Road wheels rims on all 4 corners.\nI'll call this car anything but subliminal...read on kids for\nfurther explanation.\nInteriorThe interior seats have been reupholstered with parchment\nwhite vinyl all to original factory specs thanks to a SE kit from\nLegendary Upholstery, they look brand new. Front buckets in high\nback form, complete with some puffy tuck and roll inserts and\nsmooth bolsters show as nearly new and the rear bench follows suit.\nDoor panels are also white, very clean and all correct circular\nmachined stainless Charger badge on the sills. A true to original\nwood wrapped steering wheel has the Fratzog corporate emblem\ncentral button. The factory gauge cluster lines up for you on the\nback dash front, and all spit shined and gleaming dials and knobs\nare present and accounted for upfront. A real wood pistol grip\nhandle shift lever is in the center of the restored console, with\nthe factory mac tacmaterial. Mounted in dash central is the factory\nAM radio hovering just below the slides for the heater/AC. Black\ncarpet floods the floors and has fitted Charger R/T floor mats\nembroidered in a snappy red colorway. Pure crisp perfection ladies\nand gentlemen.\nDrivetrain\nUnder the hood is certainly sublime, not only in color but in the\nfact that resting between the fenders is a potent mill that can\ndestroy anything that comes its way. A 472ci Hemi V8 sporting an\naftermarket block,hows that for some piston packing prowess? Oh,\nhow about a pair of Indy aluminum cylinder heads for good measure\nalong with an aluminum dual 4-barrel intake topped off with a\nfactory style air cleaner assembly and wrinkle finish valve covers.\nOther neat-o features are a full MSD ignition, an Afco 4 core\naluminum radiator with dual electric fans, March Enterprise\nserpentine pulley setup and full length headers and FlowMaster\nexhaust with factory style chrome tips. On the back is a 4-speed\nmanual transmission designated A833 along with an overdrive unit,\nand way back a 8 3/4\" rear axle.\nUndercarriage\nDone just right baby bear, all evenly Sublime coated, and tight as\na drum on the structural side of things. An upgradedblowproof\nbellhousing is on to accommodate the bit of extra power from those\n472 cubes, and to bring her to a stop are power from disc and power\nrear drum brakes. Torsion bars provide the front suspension ride\nand leaf springs are on the rear making for a comfortable ride that\nallows the drivetrain to put power to the ground.\nDrive-Ability\nThe horsepower specs are all in the description, but we had to see\nfor ourselves, so our resident muscle car shade tree mechanic and\ndecoder expert took her for a spin. Everything was working\nperfectly save for the AC not blowing cold and his only comment\nwhen returning was \"This car is one bad mu*#er Fu*@er!\". While\nClassic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at\nthe time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions\nwill be working at the time of your purchase.\nA Charger R/T tribute and then some touched by the hands of a\npassionate restorer who has a need for speed and penchant for\npower. Nearly perfect in every way, right out of the showroom, then\nto the restorer who only made it better, by a quarter mile!\nXP29L0G187758\nX-Dodge Charger\nP-Premium Price Class\n29-2 Door Sports Hardtop\nL-383ci 2bbl V8\n0-1970\nG-St. Louis, MO Assy Plant\n187758-Sequential Unit Number\nClassic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and\ncollectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate\ncontrolled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8\nacres!).

        "This 1968 Dodge Charger R/T 426 Hemi Tribute blazes in Viper Red, a\ncolor that screams performance and attitude. Originally a\n440-powered R/T, this Charger now flexes serious muscle with a 426\nHemi V8 under its hood. The aggressive stance is accentuated by\nperiod-correct 14-inch Chrysler mag wheels with black painted\ninserts, wrapped in BF Goodrich Radial T/A tires (P225/70R14 front,\nP225/75R14 rear). A painted metallic gray bumblebee stripe wraps\naround the rear, paying homage to its muscle car lineage. The\nbumper chrome shines brilliantly, complementing the sleek,\naerodynamic profile that made the '68 Charger a legend on street\nand track.\nInside, the ivory interior creates a striking contrast to the\nexterior's bold red. Vinyl bucket seats offer both comfort and\nperiod-correct style, while the factory center console houses the\nfloor shifter for the 3-speed automatic transmission. The dashboard\nfeatures factory-style gauges including a tachometer, essential for\nmonitoring the Hemi's performance. An aftermarket steering wheel\nwith a teak wooden perimeter adds a touch of sophistication. Modern\nconveniences blend seamlessly with classic style - a Premier AM/FM\nradio provides the tunes, while factory air conditioning keeps the\ncabin cool during spirited drives.\nThe star of this show is the 426 Hemi V8, built to produce a\ntire-shredding 550 horsepower on pump gas. The engine bay is a\nshowcase of power and engineering, featuring dual Edelbrock\nPerformer AFB-style four-barrel carburetors with electric chokes,\nsitting atop a Chrysler aluminum intake manifold. Long tube\nstainless headers feed into a dual exhaust system for that\nsignature Hemi growl. Performance upgrades continue with a\nhigh-performance aluminum radiator and twin electric fans to keep\nthis powerhouse cool. The 3-speed automatic transmission and 8 3/4\nrear end with 3.23 gears provide the perfect balance of\nacceleration and highway cruising ability.\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\u2022 426 Hemi V8 Engine (550hp)\n\u2022 3 Speed Automatic Transmission\n\u2022 Dual Edelbrock Performer AFB-style Carburetors\n\u2022 Long Tube Stainless Headers\n\u2022 Dual Exhaust System\n\u2022 High-Performance Aluminum Radiator with Twin Electric Fans\n\u2022 Power Steering\n\u2022 Power Front Disc Brakes\n\u2022 8 3/4 Rear End with 3.23 Gears\n\u2022 Viper Red Paint\n\u2022 Metallic Gray Bumblebee Stripe\n\u2022 14\" Chrysler Mag Wheels with Black Painted Inserts\n\u2022 BF Goodrich Radial T/A Tires (P225/70R14 front, P225/75R14\nrear)\n\u2022 Chrome Bumpers\n\u2022 Ivory Interior with Bucket Seats\n\u2022 Factory Center Console\n\u2022 Aftermarket Steering Wheel with Teak Wooden Perimeter\n\u2022 Factory-Style Gauges with Tachometer\n\u2022 Premier AM/FM Radio\n\u2022 Air Conditioning\n\u2022 Original 440 Engine Available\n\u2022 Restored by Realistic Auto Restoration\nThis 1968 Dodge Charger R/T 426 Hemi Tribute combines classic\nmuscle car aesthetics with modern performance upgrades.

        "Here we have a 1970 Dodge Charger R/T for sale. This car has\nundergone a meticulous frame-off restoration resulting in one of\nthe nicest Chargers in the country. There is a photo album that\ncomes with it documenting the restoration process. It's powered by\nthe matching numbers driveline and finished in a stunning color\ncombo. If you're in the market for a top-of-the-line pedigree Dodge\nCharger RT then you won't want to miss out on this one that's\nguaranteed to turn heads everywhere you go! In the following\nparagraphs, we will briefly describe this Dodge's exterior,\ninterior, and driveline, but first we would like to tell you a\nlittle about us.\nSmoky Mountain Traders is a classic car dealer in east Tennessee.\nWe are family-owned, operated, and own our entire inventory, no\nconsignments, and only deal in muscle cars and vintage autos. You\ncan always count on us to have 70 to 80 cars. We pride ourselves in\nbuying the highest quality classics and selling them to you at a\nprice that no other dealer in the country can compete with. For\nmore information, pictures, or questions, call our office at\n(865)988-8088 or visit our SmokyMountainTraders website.\nWe will start off with the exterior of this Charger. The body on it\nis laser straight down the sides and all the body lines flow\nseamlessly from front to back. Countless hours were spent prepping\nthis car during restoration, showcased by the F5K Dark Burnt Orange\nMetallic paint that is the Factory Option. It's accented by the V8X\nBumble Bee Stripes, V21 Performance Hood Treatment, and V1X Black\nVinyl top, both factory options. The paint was redone in base coat\nclear coat and has been polished out to a mirror finish that's\nslick as a ribbon. This '70 has the working hood signals along with\nhaving the factory hood tie down option. Both the front and rear\nbumpers have a brilliant finish. The drip rail molding, wheel\nopening molding, and belt line molding is all beautiful as well. We\ncan see the grill is in excellent condition along with the\nheadlights that are working as they should. All the glass is\nexcellent as well along with having had all new weather stripping\nand seals installed. To finish off the stance it's sitting on a set\nof 15\" Magnum 500 wheels with 8\" Wheels on the Front and 10\" Wheels\non the Back. They are riding on a set of BF Goodrich Radial T/A\nWhite Letter Tires.\nNext, we will look at the interior of this R/T. On the inside it's\ndone in the factory option as well with the Burnt Orange color\nscheme the provides the perfect complement to the exterior. The\ndoor panels are all excellent along with the cranks and armrest. It\nfeatures a driver-side remote mirror. All new carpet and headliner\nwere installed as well and they both have an excellent fit. The\nfactory bucket seats and rear bench seat were all redone with new\npadding, springs, and covers. We can see the center console is in\nexcellent condition as well and features the wood grain accents\nwhile also housing the Four Speed Pistol Grip Shifter. Looking at\nthe gauges we can see how well this car has been cared for because\nthey all look amazing and are working as they should. Inside the\ntrunk is all rock solid and detailed out in body color. It's\nfinished out with the correct trunk liner, jack, and spare.\nFinally, we will get to the driveline of this Dodge. Under the\nhood, the same meticulous approach that is evident on the rest of\nthe car is clear here as well. It has the matching radiator support\nalong with having the original fender tag. The power comes from the\nMatching Numbers U Code 440 V8 that's set up with the original\n2951736-1 Intake and original Carter 4737S. It's dressed in the\nfactory styled valve covers and air cleaner with the 440 Magnum\ncall out. This Charger RT comes with Power Steering and for the\nexhaust, it has the correct Manifolds with new 2 \ufffd\" dual pipes with\nthe H Pipe and Xlerator turbo style mufflers. When we look it you\ncan see they did a phenomenal job with the rotisseries resto as\nthey floors are rock solid and just as slick as the top. We can\nalso see that they welded in frame connectors and did an excellent\njob with the installation before paint. All new fuel and brake\nlines were installed along with a new gas tank. The 440 U Code\nengine runs through the Matching Numbers D21 Heavy Duty Four Speed\nTransmission and the original A33 Track Pak Dana 60 Rear End with\n3.54 Gears. On the highway, you couldn't ask for a better running\nand driving Charger! It runs out phenomenally and handles with\nease.

None of the Chargers used in the movie were ever actually powered by a blown Hemi engine, like they would like you to think.

        "This AMAZING resto-mod Charger has all the good looks from 1970,\nbut none of the bad habits, handling, or braking problems that came\nwith it from the factory. This purple powerhouse is a complete\nrethink of a 1970 Charger, starting with a clean body, this Charger\nreceived carbon fiber front fenders and a carbon fiber hood to shed\nsome weight off the front end. These beautiful carbon bits are\nfinished in FC7 Plum Crazy purple, however in the right light, just\nlike a Ferrari F40(whoever thought that name would be used in the\nsame sentence as a Charger?) you can see the weave of the carbon\nfiber showing through the paint. How awesome is that? Under the\nhood went a 6.2L Hellcat crate engine, linked to a 6-speed manual\ntransmission. This powerful powertrain was slipped into a full bolt\nin chassis from Schwartz Performance with rack and pinion power\nsteering, tubular control arms up front, adjustable coil over\nshocks all around, and a Moser full floating 9 rear axle with\n31-spline axles out back. Big 13 Wilwood disc brakes provide\nstopping power to match the horsepower and custom super wide\nsteelies wrapped in sticky rubber attempt to put all that power to\nthe pavement. Inside this mad Mopar looks fresh out of 1970,\nhowever you now have ice cold air conditioning and a retro looking\nsound system with Bluetooth that will blow your mind. This is truly\nthe ultimate Mopar resto-mod without the big build bill and years\nof build time that usually accompanies a monster such as this.

Number 22 is wrapped SHELL/Pennzoil car and Number 2 is Miller Lite. Both cars were displayed at Team Penske Race Factory inside the Museum shop. Both have their Team Penske original Dodge Nascar engines 358cid 850HP+ and Andrews Dog Box transmission 4-speed. They are set up for Road course track. These are full blown race cars. It cost the team back in 2011 $250K to build each car. Both cars were restored by Team Penske after the season and put in the Mueseum.\nVerified by Team Penske. They are true Nascars that were raced and competed in the cup series in 2011. Alot of cars that year didn't make it due to accidents. These cars were one of the few to finish with no accidents.\nChassis PRS-0111-746 (Pennzoil wrap)\n3/27/2011 California Speedway\n5/21/2011 Charlotte Motor Speedway All-Star Race\nChassis PRS-0111-749 (MillerLite wrap)\n4/30/2011 Richmond Raceway\n9/10/2011 Richmond Raceway\nI take them to car shows, and events for the kids as well as taken it to Boca Raton Concours D'elegance which it has won BEST IN CLASS. See pictures attached.\nThe reason why the last years are so desirable is because they are the last to have the carbureted engines. After that they went to fuel injection and the teams would not sell you the systems for programming or tunning. That's their own research and development patents. Therorefe after those years you wouldn't be able to tune them. So the last of the carburated ones are the ones to have.\nAll parts are available. Circle K in Mooresville NC has tons of parts just for Nascars, Atech Motorsports as well. Things like your clutch is Tilton Racing so you can order from Atech Motorsports etc.. Goodyear Tires you can get directly from SASCO. Fuel is leaded 110. I also attached a spec sheet of what fluid they require. Everything is there.\nI'm located in Miami, FL and can do a facetime or come in person. Most true race Nascars are rarely sold, and even more with their original engine. The engine is the Team patents, and they usually take them off. The engines are stamped Team Penske. & CO and are full blown Penske race engines.\nCall me ",

        "1968 Dodge Charger R/T , 440 CID , Automatic , 8 3/4 posi-traction rear end. This car was bought new in Memphis Tn it is been owned by the same family since new. The original owner passed in 2020 and left it to his daughters. It is a factory red car with white interior. A restoration was started but never completed the engine runs good and the transmission shifts good, the rear end is in good shape as well. The car has power brakes and power steering. The paint is in good shape but it is not a show car by any means most of the interior is with the car the seats and carpet arein good shape the door panels are in good shape as is the headliner although a new one is included. It has probably been driven less than 30 miles in the last 25 years. The trim tag is missing but the VIN shows it as a 68 charger R/T with a 440 375 hp engine. All the body panels are original except the quarter panels and they were replaced with panels from Year One. The floor pans and trunk are in good shape there is a couple of small spots that looked to have been patched many years ago. I am a friend of the family and am posting this for them I can send as many pictures as you want of this car. I will be glad to get it up in the air and take pictures of the undercarriage as well.
