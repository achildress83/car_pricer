The engine has 4,520miles since built. It has a Quick Fuel 4 Barrel Carburetor, ceramic coated headers, Edelbrock intake manifold, power steering and Wilwood disc brakes on all 4 wheels. Billet transmission, electronic ignition, aluminum radiator, smoothed and painted engine bay matching the exterior paint. It has a rebuilt automatic transmission, and lots of billet and chrome components.\nExterior has Mach-1 trim, chrome trim around wheel wells, chrome bumpers, black front lip spoiler, gloss black rear spoiler, and black rear window louvers. Hood has gloss black center. The car has Ridler wheels and brand-new tires (installed 1/15/2025).\nInterior is in good condition and was restored Mach-1 correct. Undercarriage is in good condition.\nKnown Flaws: There is a slow draw on the power from the battery when the car is turned off. I've had a mechanic look into it and we think the issue is the aftermarket stereo. So we havedisconnected the stereo. However, the battery also has a battery power shutoff switch, that can be usedto avoid thebattery draw. Also, the windows do not seal completely and so when the car is washed some water leaks into the interior. I believe this is common with older cars. Also, there are small scratches on the paint in various locations on the car. I can send pictures of these things upon request.\nI have owned this car since May of 2022. I have enjoyed this car. I hate to see it go. I am selling it only to free up some cash.",
        "1968 FORD MUSTANG - FULL RESTOMOD WITH 14,000 MILES IN IMPECCABLE CONDITION\nThis Ford Mustang 1968 coupe was fully restored/modified in 2014. It is in top condition with less than 14,000 miles, driven only during spring/summer months. The original car belonged to my father in-law and was powered by a 289ci V8 with a three-speed automatic transmission. Upon his passing, I undertook a 2-year project to restore and modify the car to make it car-show ready.\nThe body was taken down to its bare bones through thermal and blast stripping by Aesthetic Finishers (afpower.com) and then rebuilt and painted by Greg Huber from Kaotic Kustoms. A new (2013) crate Ford Boss 302 engine (444 HP at the crank) was installed and customized by Paul Faessler and his team from Paul\u2019s Automotive Engineering, together with a new 6 speed automatic transmission, ECU, reinforced suspension, power assisted front disc and rear drum brakes, C&R Coyote radiator with fans and trans cooler, etc. All the interior has been re-done with new upholstery using the original seats frame and door panels. All instrumentation is new, using Dakota Digital instruments but with the 1968 Mustang look. American Racing 16\u201d wheels with Michelin tires completed the package.\nThis was a single-family owned car that, unfortunately, I need to part ways with, as I am in the process of moving from Ohio to Florida and downsizing from a house to an apartment with no space to keep the car. All in, I have spent north of $100K on the car and my asking price is $60,000. Hope to find a good home that loves and enjoys this car as much as I have.\nDETAILS\nBody by Aesthetic Finishers (afipowder.com) and Greg Huber from Kaotic Kustoms\nFull thermal and blast stripping - original body with some replacement parts\nNew engine, transmission, suspension, breaks, etc. customized and installed by Paul Automotive Engineering\n2013 Boss 302 crate engine 444 HP at the crank\n6R80 6 speed automatic trans and ECU\nPBH electronic control pack\nC&R Coyote radiator module with fans and trans cooler\nFord Performance Boss 302 alternator\nFord Performance starter\nA-1 power steering pump, 20-281 w/ core.\nFront independent suspension kit\nFront disc brake kit\nClassic Air Elite Series air conditioning kit w/ Ford AC FS10 compressor\nDakota Digital, VHX67FMUSKW gauge panel, BIM-01-2 interface expansion module for speed signal.\nGT Retro wood steering wheel kit with hub and horn button\nRadio, original style with slidebar, ipod flash drive, 300 watts\nAmerican Racing 16x8 VN105 wheels / Michelin tires",

The history of the iconic Ford Mustang doesn\u2019t stop there, the experts at Fougal Creations have created a new modernised version of the legendary Mach 1 Mustang.\nThis stunning Mustang Mach 1 started life as a true 1969 manual red with black hood Mach 1.

The custom widebody was specially crafted to fit the 10-inch wider track offered by the modern suspension. Every body panels have been completely redesigned by the team at Fougal Creations. This stunning widebody was designed to enhance the exquisite original lines of the 1969 Mustang while incorporating a set of modern aerodynamics features. A custom set of lightweight 19 wheels wrapped in Michelin super sport tires improve the beautiful legendary lines of the Mach 1 which gives the car a lower stance and a very aggressive look.\nThis Mach 1 is running a fresh 5L coyote engine breathing thru a high rpm Boss 302 intake bolted to a 5 speed Tremec transmission. This 440hp Coyote engine delivers the power to a modern 8.8 limited slip rear differential. The sound design of the custom crafted 304 stainless steel side exit exhaust system has an exotic low muscle car rumble throughout its 7500rpm rev range.\nThis feeling is continued inside where a lot of time were invested into the design, material choice as well as all the small details, like the billet aluminum GT40 toggle switches in the custom center console. The details of the redesigned interior match the sharp exterior styling of this Mach 1. With modern Dakota digital gauges, to the carbon fiber door cards and X brace, to the two sport seats arrangement with a parcel shelf including storage and the space grey interior billet aluminum pieces. A cold blowing AC system and electric windows have been fitted for a more comfortable driving experience.\nThis Mach 1 is finished in the Ford GT MKIV red with black satin accents and unique Fougal Designed MACH 1 decals to match the incredible quality of the bodywork.

It also has headers that feed Flowmaster mufflers which give this car a great sound which can be heard in the video. The 4-speed transmission has been upgraded with a Hurst shifter for better performance than the original Ford setup. The factory 8\u201d rear end has been swapped out in favor of a stronger 9\u201d assembly. Front disc brakes are present along with a dual reservoir master cylinder.\nLooking inside reveals a complete black Pony (Deluxe) interior. This is a nice upgrade over the standard version and includes embossed seat backs, molded door panels, carpeted kick panels, bright trimmed pedals, woodgrain dash inserts, and a wooden steering wheel. Other features on this example include a Rally Pac with working tachometer and clock along with a remote mirror on the driver\u2019s side. The only change from stock is a modern AM/FM digital radio that fits in the original dash opening. Everything is functional including the speedometer, fuel gauge, lights, turn signals, wipers, washers, horn, and heater/defroster. The trunk is nicely finished with a mat along with a matching spare tire cover and jack bag.\nThis Mustang presents a very appealing package. It is a gorgeous car inside and out with great GT looks, but is also in turn-key condition with a V8 engine and 4-speed transmission. While this classic can be appreciated by any car collector, be prepared to draw attention from all types of people wherever you go.",

        "1966 Ford Mustang Hardtop\n\"For the very first time, American's could literally build the car\nof their dreams, as most American car manufacturers now offered\ntons of 'extras' or 'options' when ordering a new car. But, it now\nbelieved the incredible success of Ford's Mustang was not only due\nto the marketing by Lee Iacocca but, to the fact the consumer could\nactually 'build' him, or herself, a custom car by choosing from\nover 70 options offered for the 1966 Mustang! Many folks did not\nrealize Ford really meant the advertising term, the car that was\ndesigned to be designed by YOU. After paying as little as $2368\nFOB, you could load your car up with a myriad of options.\" Thx to\nFoMoCo.org\nFor consignment, a 1966 Ford Mustang hardtop, one of an astounding\n607,568 Mustangs produced in 1966, 422,416 of those being hardtops,\nfar and away the most common body type which also included\nfastbacks and convertibles. This car was restored more than 12\nyears ago and has a rebuilt 289ci V8 and was won by our consignor\nin a raffle.\nExterior\nAssembled in the eastern plant at Metuchen, New Jersey this hardtop\nwears Wimbledon White, which unlike Carlos Alcaraz's uniform, is\nactually an off white with a subtle yellow tinge. By 1966, the\nfamiliar lines and shape of the Mustang was ingrained in the\nAmerican psyche so subtle changes from the 1965 such as the new\nfaux ducts on the quarter panel, the removal of the vertical bar\nfrom the grille horse's corral, and the change from a honeycomb\ngrille design to one with straight bars were barely noticed by the\npublic but serve as important differentiators today. This car is\nmissing the panel ducts for a clean unobstructed body line that\ncreates a soft cove. The chrome and bright work are very nice on\nthe car and wheel covers on the 14-inch wheels show a bit of patina\nbut are entirely presentable. The paint is in beautiful condition\non the car with no notable flaws however a few of the panel gaps\nare less than perfect, and sometimes they left that plant that\nway.\nInterior\nBlack was the simple title of the interior palette and begins with\nthe door panels in varying patterns of vinyl and housing manual\nlocks, crank windows, and a corner wind window secured by a metal\nlatch. Inside, standard low back bucket seats with tuck and roll\ninsert are situated up front while 2+2 seating that essentially\nflank the center tunnel live in the back and everything is in very\nfine condition. The steering wheel fronts a simple dash where five\ngauges present to the driver including the large, center 140mph\nspeedometer housed in textured hard plastic showing, typically, a\nbit of patina. Metal switchgear provides robust controls and an\nAM/FM/Cassette player is in the center, reachable from driver and\npassenger alike. A center console is striped with finned metal trim\nthat breaks for the T-handle shifter and indicator plate. Black\nloop carpet covers the floor nicely and the headliner is a bit\nloose but fully intact. The trunk is clean and lined with a period\nplaid mat.\nDrivetrain\nUnder the hood, a clean, driver quality 289ci V8 rebuilt by Jasper\nEngines who put a \"slight\" cam in and added headers, along with a\nHolley 4-barrel carburetor. A C4 3-speed automatic transmission\nsends power to the Ford 8\" rear and drum brakes bring it all to a\ncrawl.\nUndercarriage\nDriver quality underneath as well where surface rust is common\nincluding on the exhaust which flows from the headers to a pair of\nstock style muffler, then out chrome down turned tips that extend\npast the rear valance. It's relatively clean and dry otherwise\nunderneath with no grease build up, some road spray that can be\nhosed off, and no leaks other than some residual oil on the rear\ndifferential. Coil springs make up the suspension in front and leaf\nsprings are out back and we note some rust repair was performed on\nthe front of the driver's inner rocker panel.\nDrive-Ability\nThe healthy little V8 fired right up and the Mustang trotted onto\nthe test loop with adequate power, good tracking, and braking that\nfunctioned well. No surprises here and other than the horn not\nworking, all other functions such as lights, radio, turn signals\nand others worked as expected. While Classic Auto Mall represents\nthat these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we\ncannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of\nyour purchase.\nHere's a nice, basic pony, well sorted, showing no invasive rust,\nand a complete, clean interior. If a hardtop classic Mustang is on\nyour wishlist, be sure to add this Wimbledon White example to your\nsearch. This one is an ace and once you make the call, it will be\ngame, set, match!

        "On March 2, 1966, the one millionth Mustang drove off the assembly\nline and opened the door for Ford to ramp up its sales operations\nto a new level with a Millionth Mustang Success Sale. Ford made\nMustang more enticing by offering special Mustang models throughout\nthe year.Midway through the 1966 model year, the limited-edition\nSprint 200 package began to be promoted due to the overwhelming\ndemand for the 289 c.i.d. V-8, which Ford was running short of.\nWhat Ford was not running short of however was the 200 c.i.d. six\ncylinder; a direct result of the dismal sales of the\nnewly-redesigned Falcon for 1966 (which also used this inline six\nas its standard engine). In order to give the six cylinder a nice\nsales boost, Ford offered a special Sprint 200 option package.The\nMustang Sprint 200 was a Ford promotion that would avoid a\nproduction slowdown in which the readily-available 200 six would be\ndressed up with a chrome air cleaner with a special decal and a\nchrome oil-filler cap. Two transmission packages were offered; 'A'\nsignified the car having a manual transmission, while 'B' cars had\nautomatics.Known as the The Sprint 200, the package was offered mid\n1966 and was marketed as a sporty package specifically designed for\nthe base 200 cubic inch 6 cylinder engine. Sprint options included\ncenter floor console; painted side accent stripes (color matched\nwith the car's interior); deletion of the chrome rear quarter\nornaments; a set of deluxe 48 spoke, blue center wire-style wheel\ncovers; and a 'Sprint 200' decal on the engine's chrome air cleaner\ncover.It is estimated that of the total number of Sprint 200\nMustangs built in the 1966 model year that 75% of them were package\n'B' automatics. Further enhancements would be made both in the\ninterior as well as the exterior with the interior center console\nwith courtesy lights, side accent paint stripe (color matched with\nthe car's interior), and the deluxe wire-style wheel covers.The\nSprint name was rarely used in Ford advertising; the package was\nsold mostly under the guise of three distinct promotions, offered\nonly as 'Limited Edition' Mustangs. A number of convertibles and\nfastbacks were offered under these promotions as well, but it seems\nas though their availability was never advertised. While most\nMustangs with the Sprint 200 label were primarily sold in the early\nmonths of 1966, some were built as early as November 1965 and some\nas late as August of 1966. An estimated 20,000 were produced in\n1966 yet only about 400 are in the active registry and known to\nstill be in existence and on the road today.This is one of the few\nLimited Edition 1966 Mustang Sprint 200's left in existence and on\nthe road. With only 89k original miles, it was originally produced\non April 26, 1966 at the Metuchen Ford Plant. This Mustang has the\nSprint 'b' package with indicates it has the C-4 Cruise-a Matic\nautomatic transmission. It has under gone an extensive rotisserie\nrestoration. Repainted in the original Wimbledon white with red\ninterior & trim. Original door data tag still riveted to the door\nsill. Original engine tag still affixed to engine block.

        "The Boss 429, sometimes referred to as the \"\"Boss 9\"\" by blue oval\nenthusiasts, is arguably one of the rarest and most valued muscle\ncars from the era. In total, there were 859 original '69 Boss 429s\nand only 499 for the 1970 model year. The origin of the Boss 429\nwas as a result of Ford's desire to compete in NASCAR. Ford was\nseeking to develop a Hemi engine that could take on the Mopar Hemi\nboys: the 426 Hemi Charger Daytona and Plymouth Superbirds, the\nmonsters Ford wanted to slay to achieve its desire to rule the\ntrack. NASCAR required that at least 500 cars be fitted with the\ncompetition motor and sold to the general public for homologation\npurposes.\nThe Boss 429 engine featured aluminum cylinder heads, which had a\nmodified Hemi-type combustion chamber, which Ford called\n\"\"crescent\"\". The Boss 429 engine used a single 735 CFM Holley\n4-barrel carburetor on an aluminum intake manifold. All these cars\nhad the Hurst competition shifter and 4-speed manual transmissions,\nand the Boss was rated very conservatively at 375 HP, while actual\noutput was believed to be well over 500 HP.\nMustangs were simply too small to accept the massive Boss 429\nengine, so Ford hired Kar Kraft of Brighton, Michigan, to modify\nexisting 428 Cobra Jet and Super Cobra Jet Mach 1 Mustangs.\nModifications included widening the shock towers and extending out\nthe inner fenders. The mounts for the front suspension were chopped\nand displaced to create room for the block and exhaust manifolds.\nThe battery was repositioned to the trunk, and a stiff .75-inch\nsway bar was added to the rear end to improve handling since the\ncar was now nose heavy. It was also equipped with a 3.91-ratio rear\naxle with a Traction-Lok limited-slip differential. In addition, a\nhole was cut in the hood, and a manually controlled hood scoop was\nadded. Other features included a front spoiler and color-keyed dual\nracing mirrors.\nWhile the Boss 429 was an unusual platform to build a road race car\nfrom, as the 429 engine is very heavy and leads to unequal weight\ndistribution and poor handling characteristics, the extra power of\nthe 429 helped make up for time in the straights.\nThis Boss 429 was purchased new on January 7, 1970 at Jim Blackman\nFord in Sebring, Florida. It was originally a Calypso Coral street\ncar that was converted to race specs in 1974 by its first owner,\nNeil Potter. This is \"\"Orange Blossom III\"\" and is one of only two\nBoss 429s known to have been raced in the IMSA Camel GT series. It\nraced 1975-77 in events like the Sebring 12 Hours of Endurance and\nthe 24 Hours of Daytona, and it competed with all the best sports\ncars of the period.\nRetired after the 1977 race season, the car was placed into a\nstorage building at the Sebring race track. After a tornado in\n1983, the car was moved from its track storage to Potter's barn,\nwhere it was disassembled for future restoration. In 1985, Potter\nfinally sold his car and parts as a basket case to the second\nowner, who planned to do a complete the restoration. It passed to\nthe cars third owner in 1990, still in unrestored condition. A\ncomplete restoration began in 2005 and required extensive sheet\nmetal repair. The comprehensive rotisserie restoration was\ncompleted in 2009, and the car was subsequently shown at the Mid\nAmerica Shelby meet that same year, where it was awarded first in\nits class and listed in the Boss 429 registry.",

        "1966 Ford Mustang Hardtop\n\"In the mid 1950's, Ford modernized its production facilities in\nNorthern and Southern CA, building this new assembly plant in\nMilpitas, nearby to San Jose, in 1955 to replace its Richmond plant\nthat opened on 08/01/1931. In Southern CA, Ford closed its Long\nBeach and Maywood facilities, the former opened at about the same\ntime as the Richmond one, replacing both of them in 1956 with a new\nfactory in Pico Rivera. After the plant closed in the 80's, it was\nturned into a giant mall with over a million square feet.\nThxPCAD.lib.washington.edu\nFor consignment, a 1966 Ford Mustang hardtop showing 153,630 miles\nwhich are not actual. A car born at the San Jose facility, dressed\nas a GT350 and presenting with stunning paint, a clean interior,\nand a binder full of receipts and build records.\nExterior\nThe first thing that hits us, and not just because we're standing\nin its way, is the race ready GT350-R inspired front fascia that\nincludes a lower intake flanked by marker lights under a horseless\ngrille and inset headlights. Then there's the silver stripes that\nstart on said intake and work their way up and are painted across\nthe hood where pins keep the newly sucked air from blowing the hood\noff. There's some downforce too as a rising hood scoop peels\nairflow from the hood and sends it down the air filter below.\nSurrounding the stripes is beautiful Sapphire Blue paint which is\ninterrupted on the rocker panel by GT350 stripes and callouts which\nteam up with the side scoops and 15-inch polished American Racing\nTorque Thrust wheels for a racier than stock profile. In back, a\nCobra emblem adorns the billet style gas cap above a straight and\nclean chrome bumper and a blue rear valance that holds the exhaust\ntips and reverse lights. A single vertical scratch represents the\nonly exterior imperfection we could find.\nInterior\nSilver paint serves to frame the black vinyl door cards in an\nattractive twist on the Mustang door panel. The low back bucket\nseats flank a center console with storage, an armrest, and\ncupholders that fills an otherwise sparse space and the back seats,\nsurrounded by walls of silver paint, are fresh and clean. The 3\nspoke steering wheel gives up some of the polished column real\nestate to a tachometer and additional gauges in a twin pod are\nfound under the dash. The main gauge cluster is fairly standard\nalthough the materials around it have been updated to reflect the\nsilver and black interior palette. An AM/FM radio sits in the\ncenter, a straight line up from the floor mounted Hurst shifter\nwith a big white ball handle over low pile black carpet in\nexcellent condition, protected by Boss 302 carpeted mats as a nod\nto yet another Ford legend. The headliner sits high and tight and\nalong with the visors, is in excellent condition. Carpet that lines\nthe trunk shows some wear but nobody at the car show will care.\nDrivetrain\nUnder the hood we find a clean 302ci V8 engine with aluminum heads\nand a Holley 600 cfm 4-barrel perched on top. It's show quality\nclean and tied to a Toploader 4-speed manual transmission that\nsends power to the Ford 8\" axle in back with a consignor stated\n3.73 gears with TracLoc. Unassisted brakes are configured as front\ndisc and rear drums.\nUndercarriage\nWickedly clean and dry underneath with only wisps of surface rust,\ngeneral usage dust, and no oil drips in sight! The dual exhaust\ncomes from headers on the engine and intersect glasspack style\nmufflers before routing around the gas tank to exit through the\nrear valance in epic fashion. Coil springs reside in the front for\nsuspension while leaf springs are employed in the rear.\nDrive-Ability\nA healthy breathing 302 fires up and enjoys a bit of sound tuning\nfrom the glasspacks and the resulting music is as exciting as the\nWilliam Tell Overture performed by the Boston Pops. A shift into\nfirst with the Hurst and off we go onto the test loop where the car\nexhibits some fine acceleration, smooth handling, straight\ntracking, and very good braking. Our symphony will not be\ninterrupted by other sounds as the horn does not work, nor the\nradio which we're told is disconnected because it drains the\nbattery. All other functions work on this quick blue pony and it's\nback to the stable we go. While Classic Auto Mall represents that\nthese functions were working at the time of our test drive, we\ncannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of\nyour purchase.\nWe think it was Fred Sanford who said, \"my get up and go, got up\nand went.\". But that's not the case with this 59 year old car\nthat's been refreshed with the fountain of youth. It's got plenty\nof giddy up and can get up and go, and do so in a stunning\ncombination of silver and blue. A GT350 tribute in notchback form,\nthis is a well sorted Mustang that's ready for the street. It only\nneeds a new jockey. You won't need a horsewhip to get this one\ngoing, just a gentle nudge of your right foot.\n6R07T160177\n6-1966\nR-San Jose, CA Assy Plant\n07-Mustang Hardtop\nT-200ci 1bbl I6\n160177-Sequential Unit Number\nWARRANTY PLATE\nBODY 65A-Mustang Hardtop Standard Vinyl Buckets\nCOLOR F-Arcadian Blue\nTRIM 22-Blue Standard Vinyl Buckets\nDATE 01D-April 1st\nDSO 72-San Jose\nAXLE 6-Ford 8\" 2.80 Conventional\nTRANS 6-C4 Automatic\nClassic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and\ncollectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate\ncontrolled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8\nacres!).

All the panels have been beautifully\naligned, and the doors close easily with minimal effort. All the\nglass, rubber seals and fuzzy strips were replaced. It is equipped\nwith dual side mirrors. All the chrome has a lustrous shine. It has\nturn signal indicators built into the hood and the fastback vents\nare functional. The front grille is in great shape and it has GT\nfog lights.

        "This 1966 Ford Mustang Convertible is a sporty little summer\ncruiser loaded with fantastic options! Coming out of the 1950s and\ninto the early 1960s, there was a gap in the American automotive\nmarket; there were no \"cool\" compact cars. Under the direction of\nfamed Ford executive Lee Iacocca, the Ford Motor Company sought to\nfill that gap and that's exactly what Ford did on April 17, 1964,\nwhen the Mustang was introduced at the New York World's Fair. The\ninitial vision for the new Mustang was a sporty, youth oriented car\nwith a long hood, short deck, and a modest price tag. While the\nfirst-year Mustangs sold extremely well, with Ford producing over\n125,000 units, no one could have guessed that Mustang would\nultimately snowball into one of the most successful Ford vehicles\nof all time and launch an entire new genre of muscle cars known as\n\"Pony Cars.\" In its second year, and the first full year of\nproduction, Ford would go on to produce nearly 600,000 Mustangs so\nby 1966, Ford was not going to mess with what was working for them\nin the Mustang and in turn the '66 Mustang was similar to the '65\nversion. In fact, Ford's advertising promoted the 1966 Mustang with\nthe tag line \"Relax Mustang lovers. Your favorite car hasn't\nchanged much in 1966.\" The most apparent upgrade made to the 1966\nMustang was the addition of a newly redesigned grille, shifting\naway from the '65 honeycomb style to the horizontal bar, floating\nMustang look. The interiors were also updated a bit, most notably,\nthe 1966 Mustang received a brand new 5 pot instrument cluster\ntreatment that gave the new Mustang more of a race car look and\nfeel. With these minor stylistic changes, the Mustang continued to\nbe a massively successful vehicle for the Ford Motor Company with\nthe Mustang commanding a 7.1% market share for overall US\nautomobile sale and being said that over 1.25 million Mustangs were\non the roads by the end of 1966. This particular Mustang\nConvertible comes to us from long term single family ownership who\ndid a wonderful job as stewards of this classic Pony Car. Powering\nthis '66 Mustang Convertible is a 289 Cubic Inch V8 engine fed by a\nsingle 4 barrel carburetor that together were said to have produced\n225 horsepower when new. The A-Code 289 V8 is backed by an\nAutomatic transmission that makes this '66 Mustang an easy car for\nanybody to take for a spin around the block. Exhaust exits the Ford\npowerplant via a dual exhaust setup that generates a terrific\nthroaty sound out of the rear tailpipes. This 1966 Ford Mustang\ncomes loaded with options! With power steering, maneuvering in and\nout of a tight parking space at the local car show or ice cream\nparlor is a total breeze and the overall driving experience is much\nimproved. The white vinyl power convertible top is in wonderful\ncondition and it goes up and down with the simple flick of a\nswitch. Additionally, when the power top is in the down position,\nit tucks neatly underneath a red boot cover. Riding on a set of\nwhitewall radial tires, each paired with a full wheelcover, this\n1966 Mustang has a fantastic look and an even better ride cruising\ndown the road. The exterior of this Mustang Convertible has been\ncorrectly refinished in Candy Apple Red paint that completes the\ngorgeous exterior look of this Pony Car. The interior of this 1966\nFord Mustang Convertible is dazzling! The front bucket seats and\nrear bench seat have been correctly reupholstered in Red vinyl with\nthe correct Deluxe Pony inserts.

        "Certified 1 of 1 390-4V Big Block Mustang Fastback\nThis is a beautiful show-quality car originally out of California that is a very rare X code experimental model representing Ford\u2019s first steps into emission controls on muscle cars. Marti Report verified as a genuine 1 of 1, only car like this ever made. Today it has a 4V Holley which makes this car like any other S Code. The car was fully restored and engine rebuilt right before I bought it in 2014. It seems to have a sporty cam and some additional power from the rebuild.Since that time I had two kids and it has mostly lived in my garage in a Car Capsule (that I will include) and I only drive it very occasionally or just start it once a month to keep the fluids moving. It has less than 1,000 miles since I have owned it.\nThe interior is excellent with only a few modern upgrades including retractable shoulder belts and modern radio that looks vintage. New instrument bezel and lens, 67-68 center console, new dash pad, new carpeting and mats. Seats are excellent, rear fold down seats work and look great. Trunk is fully furnished with original style plaid mats and covers and comes with a jack, jumper cables, and some other maintenance items. The paint is a very nice show-quality job with only a few spots with \u2018drips\u2019 in the paint, I would rate it 98%.\nThe only item left to make this car 100% is the A/C. This is a factory A/C car and has all the interior parts but not the parts under the hood. It will need a compressor, condenser, etc. This should be easy enough to complete and I have deducted from the pricing.\n390-4V Big Block Engine with a 750 Holley, will include original size 650 Holley\nEdelbrock Performer RPM Aluminum intake\nMallory Electronic Ignition\nBrand new high CCA AGM battery\nFlowmaster American Thunder exhaust, will include original style exhaust tips\nFord High Performance exhaust manifolds\nC-6 Automatic transmission with Cruise-O-Matic shifter\n9in rear end with 2.75 ratio, will also include 3.25 and 3.5 ring and pinions and rear master bearing rebuild kit\nBrand new valve cover gaskets, fresh oil, and new baffled oil pan\n16x7 American Racing Torq Thrust 2 Aluminum wheels\nBF Goodrich g-Force Sport tires, only couple hundred miles of use\nGrant steering wheel, will include original wheel\nCustom Autosound Slidebar radio, new speaker, power antenna\nRetractable shoulder seat belts in front\n67-68 Center Console\nNew carpet, mats, instrument bezel, dash pad\nAll chrome, bumpers, decals, gas cap, interiors are new or looknew\nDeluxe Marti Report, Marti 1 of 1 certification, replica original bill of sale\nCap Capsule car storage and protection included\nThis is a stunning machine with big block power that runs great and sounds amazing.. and it will also beat any modern car off the line :) It is ready to drive straight to the car show or local \u2018cars and coffee\u2019 and will put a smile on any driver\u2019s face!",

        "This is a stunning Poppy Red 1965 Ford Mustang C-code convertible with a white interior and black convertible top. It has manual steering and brakes, staying true to its classic roots.\nThis car has been part of my family since 1981, when my Dad purchased it as a 20th wedding anniversary gift for my Mom. For a decade, it was our family\u2019s summer fun car, creating countless cherished memories. After my Mom\u2019s passing in 1991, the Mustang sat in storage until I inherited it in 2013.\nOver the past several years, I transformed the car into a restomod sleeper hot rod\u2014a powerful and thrilling ride that\u2019s a joy to drive. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the major upgrades and work completed:\nEngine:\nRebuilt and stroked to 331 cubic inches (1,000 miles since rebuild)\nScat crank and rods, Ford Strokers custom cam, AFR 185 heads\nEdelbrock Performer RPM intake and Victor aluminum water pump\nSummit 600 CFM carb with electric choke, Doug\u2019s Headers, Griffin aluminum radiator\nDrivetrain:\nConverted to a 5-speed manual (Modern Driveline kit)\nTremec T-5 transmission, hydraulic clutch, 8\" rear with 3.55 Eaton Truetrac\nSuspension and Brakes:\nStreet or Track front suspension with Bilstein shocks\nSSBC front disc brake conversion with new brake and fuel lines\nInterior and Comfort:\nDynamat sound-deadening throughout\nSpeedhut gauges\nExhaust:\nDual Flowmaster system\nWhile the car is mechanically solid and incredibly fun to drive (it\u2019s like a 400-horsepower spaghetti noodlewith the top down!), there are a few areas for improvement. The convertible top needs replacing, the paint shows wear with chips in some spots, and thechrome could use attention. Despite these imperfections, it still looks fantastic from a few steps away and turns heads everywhere it goes.\nPricing this car has been a challenge\u2014$34,000 is my best estimate based on comps, but I\u2019m open to reasonable offers.\nThis car has brought me joy through family memories and the restoration process, but it\u2019s time for someone else to make their own memories.

        "THE STORY\nPer its listing in the official Shelby Registry, this Sunlit Gold 1968 GT500 Convertible, No. 02739, was originally shipped to Robie Ford Sales in Dorchester, Massachusetts, after its conversion into a Shelby on the A.O. Smith assembly line in Michigan.\nBy 1968, the Shelby Mustang had reached a new level of maturity and refinement., described in Shelby advertising and literature as \u201cThe Road Car.\u201d No longer the loud and boisterous boy-racer of 1965, the fourth year of Carroll Shelby\u2019s Mustang offered a combination of performance, handling, comfort and distinctive styling, especially the stylized rollbar in the first regular production Shelby convertible. With design assistance from Ford, the 1968 Shelby\u2019s fiberglass panels were updated with a new nose with Lucas fog lights in the grille, hood with forward-placed twin scoops, and rear end with sequential 1965 Thunderbird taillights. While the standard Mustang big-block was a 390, the Shelby GT500 stepped up to a 360 HP 428 Police Interceptor with an aluminum high-rise intake manifold, 735 CFM Holley 4-barrel carburetor, open-element oval air cleaner and finned aluminum valve covers.\nThe Mustang\u2019s woodgrain-trimmed Deluxe interior was enhanced by a special Shelby console with Stewart-Warner gauges and a thick, padded armrest with an embossed Shelby snake logo. Capable but smooth handling was provided by the Mustang\u2019s heavy-duty suspension that was updated to Shelby specs with unique progressive-rate springs, adjustable Gabriel shocks and a thicker front sway bar. Power steering and power front disc brakes were also part of the Shelby package. This beautiful Sunlit Gold 1968 Shelby GT500 Convertible is equipped with the popular 15-inch 10-spoke wheels.

This is a driver\nquality Mustang that should give you many years of good service. It\nruns and drives really well. Aluminum radiator does its job keeping\nit cool. The doors close good the windows go up and down fine. The\nunderside is so so. Has had rust repair. Couple of things I really\nlike about this Mustang is it still has it's two barrel carburetor\non it and a single exhaust system. This tells me that nobody's\nreally been playing with his car. Adding a 4 barrel carburetor and\ndual exhaust would add a lot. They have added some really good\nthings like the power, front disc brakes and the aluminum radiator\nwith a cruise fan for better cooling and air conditioning. I took\nit out and drove it on the back roads in the farm country just\nnorth of us. It drove great. I drove it back from Sedro-Woolly\nalso. So I put a total of about 30 miles on it. It was in the low\n80s and the engine temperature was rock solid never overheating or\nanything.

These cars\nwere priced between $2,700 and about $5,300 which seems like\nchicken feed today, but $5,300 is equal to $44,800 in today's\nmoney, so amassing a collection in 1970 would not have been that\neasy.\nFor consignment, a 1971 Ford Mustang Mach 1, showing 72,679 miles\nwhich are non actual. As the brochure prompted, \"Put yourself into\na '71 Mustang. Then put your mark on it with this challenging\nselection of better idea options.\". And indeed, three different\nrooflines, three different engines, and six different models gave\nshoppers different levels of performance and luxury to choose from.\n36,496 people walked away with Mach 1's in 1971, but none came in\nthis interesting color!\nExterior\nBurnt Orange is a color we've grown accustomed to in 2024 and looks\ngood on the big body of the Mach 1, finished in two stage\nbase/clear for lasting gloss. And there's lots of sinister black\nhere to contrast the orange, and it works well. The bumpers, chin\nspoiler, hexagon grille, body stripe, and spoiler are all black and\nare complemented by smoked, modernized headlights, window trim, and\nthe classic rear fascia which picks up on the hexagons and lens\ntrim. Chrome lovers need not fret however, as the 15-inch US Mag\nwheels offer some metallic shine to the profile. And what a\nprofile! It's the distinctive Sportsroof offered in '71 on both the\nMach and the Boss, but you could also get a base Mustang with that\nlarge, sloping rear. But what it didn't have were the aggressive\nintake scoops in the hood, now iconic triangular ducts that also\ngraced the Boss 351. The paint and panel gaps are nice here with\nimperfections noted only as a deep scratch on the rear valance,\nsome bubbling down low, and some rust on the very bottom corner of\na door.\nInterior\nThe guards in the 1971 film \"Escape from Planet of the Apes\" wore\nblack vests with geometric patterns that were trending at the time\nand seen on the door panels of this car, in black vinyl, with\nsquares and circles embossed in the material. Tight black vinyl\nwith design lines covers the newly upholstered tall back bucket\nseats in front and look great and material and conditions are\ncopied in the 2+2 seating in back where the rising roof provides\ngood headroom. A GT steering wheel fronts a black painted cluster\nsurround, and three round gauges are in plain view of the driver. A\nrow of three gauges heads the center stack under a cubby and above\nan AM radio and that leads to the vent controls and an analog\nclock. The dash pad is a black affair covered in textured vinyl and\nroughly cut in some areas, while the center console is a tidy\narrangement of the standard Ford shifter in front of a formed\nplastic storage bin. Black loop carpet is in good condition as is\nthe stitched headliner above our heads. The large trunk wears a new\nliner.\nDrivetrain\nUnder the massive hood we find a clean 351ci Cleveland V8 with a\n4-barrel carburetor, headers, and a C4 3-speed automatic\ntransmission. Power is sent to the Ford 8\" in back and the momentum\nis halted by power disc brakes up front and power drums in the rear\nwhich are part of an upgrade made by a previous owner, along with\nsuspension components.\nUndercarriage\nOn the hunt for new components, we do find the leaf springs to be\nfresh, along with sway bars and other obviously new pieces. Along\nwith the leaf springs in back, the car has coil springs in the\nfront. Dual exhaust comes off the header and through glasspack\nstyle mufflers finally exiting through straight pipes escorted\nthrough the rear of the car via cutouts in the valance. There's\nsome typical patina otherwise and a few drops of oil on the pan,\nbut nothing waving red flags underneath.\nDrive-Ability\nThere's a charm in the simplicity of it all. A few gauges, a basic\nshifter, and an orderly interior, not much to distract from the\ntask at hand, driving. And with a turn of the key, you become alert\nand aware, there's no cruise control, lane assist, or ABS. You're\nall in. Our ride was gratifying in that the 351 puts out plenty of\npower and has a nice growl to go along with it. The car handles\nwell on the newer suspension and brakes are on point. We note the\ndash lights don't illuminate and the tach is not working. All other\nitems operate as they should. While Classic Auto Mall represents\nthat these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we\ncannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of\nyour purchase.\nHere's a real deal Mach 1 in a unique color with some tasteful trim\nwork, a distinctive shape, and some of the meanest hood scoops in\nthe business! It's well sorted and ready for both show and go. The\nfurther we get from 1971, the more collectible these seem to be,\nand the Sportsroof that once seemed unusual and out of place, now\nmakes them unique and special. This big bodied 'Stang is ready for\na new stable. Grab the reins, cowpoke, and lead this wild one\nhome.\n1T05F154863\n1-1971\nT-Metuchen, NJ Assy Plant\n05-Mustang Mach 1\nF-302ci 2bbl V8\n154863-Sequential Unit Number\nClassic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and\ncollectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate\ncontrolled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8\nacres!).

        "1965 Ford Mustang Hardtop\nAdvertisements became popular reminders of the Mustang's youthful\nspirit, such as one featuring two mature adults sitting in a new\nMustang with the words, \"Youth is a wonderful thing. What a crime\nto waste it on children.\". It was the car to have if you were\nseeking the fountain of youth. The 1965 Ford Mustang was the car to\nhave if you were looking to win over your neighbor or hit the road\nfor fun and adventure. It was also a must have for enthusiastic\ndrivers and car enthusiasts who simply liked to drive.\nFor consignment, a 1965 example of the very popular Ford Mustang\nfrom the first yearand in hardtop form with 127,919 title verified\nactual miles on the odometer. Purchased by our consignor, the third\nowner and treated to a full on restoration in 2008 make for one\ngreat driving, simple to work on 6 cylinderpony with a manual\ntransmission. A driver's driver if you will, complete with all its\nreceipts over the years and even retaining thebuild sheet and\noriginal salesman's business card. A nice redux in the correct\nfactory paint color and a beautiful interior which is clean and\nbasic yet functional. One of the great examples here donning the\nhalls of Classic Auto Mall.\nExterior\nDriver quality plus sultry Rangoon Red paint drapes the straight\nsteel panels of this car. A few inclusions and minor bubbles are\nseen on the lowers of the doors and there are grinding marks in the\nbumper where a bolt head was cut out in the past. Overall shiny and\nnice red paint over straight steel panels that are minding their\ngaps make up the body. Up front, flanking the galloping Mustang\nbadge are the single headlights in the faux vented inserts. Like\nnew chrome, correct and very nice badging, the hockey stick cove\nwith the chromed trim on the rear quarter and clean lines running\nthe length of the body. With shiny standard issues 14-inch wheel\ncovers, this first year Mustang has you arriving in style and\nclass. Deeply treaded 205/70R14 thin white stripe radials wrap\nthose snazzy chrome wheels.\nInterior\nWith nearly every part of a 1st generation Mustang interior\navailable from a catalog it's hard to tell these days what's\noriginal and what'sreplaced. But I can tell you this, the interior\nbefore us is clean, mean and looking just fine. Red ribbed vinyl\ndoor cards grace the textured steel door shells and are dressed\nwith chrome for the cranks. Slipping inside leads our posteriors to\na pair of red tuck and roll and smooth vinyl lowback bomber style\nbuckets, all in excellent condition, nice and tight, and show no\nsigns of wear. A matching bench is in the rear and appears as nice\nas the buckets. Red carpet, clean and like new, floats this\ninterior and is protected by ribbed red rubber mats up front and\nholds the chrome T-handle shifter on the hump. In front, this dash\nis all original with the central speedometer, and a single flanking\ncircular gauge cluster on either side. A factory steering wheel is\nin front of this dash, showing a few cracks, and as we pan right,\nan original AM radio is inserted and installed into the center. A\nnote to the trunk space with the plaid vinyl liner,tools in the\ncorrect bag, and full size spare..\nDrivetrain\nUnder the hood we see a very nicely restored and rebuilt 200ci\ninline 6 cylinder. It is in a really clean black engine bay with\nthe engine painted Ford Black and contrasting red painted valve\ncover and air cleaner to compliment the black. On top is a 1-barrel\ncarburetor and nice supple rubber hoses and no corrosion can be\nseen under this hood. On back is a 3-speed manual transmission\nwhich sends power to a 7.25\" rear axle weighing in with 3.20\ngears.\nUndercarriage\nOverall very nice underneath, clean black paint, surface rust on\nthe usual suspects, solid floor pans and toe kicks and rockers. We\nnote the flooring has been replaced in the past, there are a few\nsmall repairs to the shock towers, and there is the beginnings of\ninvasive rust on the rear of the right front unibody rail. Drum\nbrakes are on all 4 corners and we note independent coil spring\nsuspension up front and leaf springs in the back. Bottom inside of\nthe doors are clean, and the thresholds are looking good. Single\nexhaust is on in stock form and looking good, albeit with some\nsurface rust.\nDrive-Ability\nA very easy starter with a smooth idle during warmup. Off to the\ntest track, and here at said track, this car performed flawlessly.\nNice smooth acceleration, tight steering, and bias free panic\nstopping. Shifting was a breeze with the manual, and cruising at\nhighway speed proved no problem for the 6 cylinder under the hood.\nWhile Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were\nworking at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these\nfunctions will be working at the time of your purchase.\nWith some nice new restored parts on this car it has a touch of\npony class, and just a little extra than the run of the mill 1965\nMustang. Turn the key, enjoy and drive without the fear of a stone\nchip or scratch in a multi-thousand dollar paint job.

        "1965 Ford Mustang T5 Hardtop\nThe long awaited new sports car from Ford, the Mustang was\nintroduced with much fanfare to the public in early April of 1964.\nThe car featured innovative styling and was offered with several\nchoices of engines, transmissions and options. The Mustang proved\nto be an instant success selling over 400,000 units the first year.\nEarly in the production cycle Ford encountered a problem while\ntrying to export Mustangs to Germany in the usual manner used with\nexport vehicles. Ford solved this marketing dilemma the easiest way\npossible, they simply changed the name of all Mustangs exported to\nGermany to Ford T5 which had been used as the internal project code\nduring development of Mustang. Sometime in the early 1950s a German\ntruck manufacturer, Krupp, introduced a large general purpose truck\nand named it the Mustang. They were issued German copyrights to the\nname Mustang and continued to build this truck for many years. This\ntruck was built in several configurations including a dump truck\nand a fire engine. This then was the situation with the name\nMustang that Ford faced when they tried to sell their successful\npony car in Germany. Rather than simply buying the name from Krupp\nfor a reported $10,000 they chose instead to change the name of all\nMustangs exported to Germany to Ford T5s. T5 has no specific\nmeaning but it was the original project name for the Mustang in the\nearly 1960's.\nFor consignment, a mostly original car with light handed tasteful\nmodifications to improve on the original. A 1965 289ci V8 C-code\ncar with a newer mill is here for the taking and showing 4,169\nnon-verifiable miles on the odometer. In the early models, 65 and\n66, several modifications were incorporated to change the car from\na Mustang to a T5. The 65's received modified hub caps with a plain\nblack center; both model years had the word Mustang removed from\nthe horn ring, rear gas cap and a few other minor changes. Other\nthan the branding, the mechanical changes to T5, as well as to\nMustangs for other countries, were mostly limited to replacing the\nexterior lighting to meet European regulations, as well as some\nsuspension tuning changes and installation of the shock tower brace\nfrom the Shelby GT350 to better suit continental roads. Ford did\ndesign new emblems for the front fender to designate the cars as\nT5s. Draped in a one year only hue of Silversmoke Gray, and a black\nstandard interior, this well optioned car painstakingly restored\nand ready to gallop out of our Hallowed Halls and into your\npersonal stable. We proudly offer you this 1st year pony from Ford,\none of less than 340 T5 ponys to make its way back to US soil and\nnumber 13 in the T5 registry. Get ready to kick up some dust and\nfall in love with 1965 all over again.\nExterior\nA beautiful Silversmoke Gray respray covers the exterior of this\ncar and has some inclusions and scratches in a few areas but\notherwise a very nice respray of the factory color. The restored\nmetal is very straight with good gaps and we see the correct T5\nbadging on the fenders next to the red, white and blue galloping\nhorse. Thin mustache-like chrome bumpers present well as does the\ngrille surround and floating crosshair flanked corralled horse, and\nspear assembly.

        "1966 Ford Mustang Fastback\n1966 proved to be one of the most successful years for the Ford\nMustang, accounting for over 20% of the first generation Mustang\nproduction. 607,568 Ford Mustangs rolled off Ford assembly lines\nfor the 1966 model year to satisfy strong demand for the original\nPonycar. Of these, only 27,809 were fastback editions. This body\nstyle has become the most sought after collectible in today's\nmarketplace. It was on the fastback platform that Shelby created\nthe legendary GT-350 Mustangs. Their street performance,\ncompetition & market success bolstered the Mustangs stature in\nperiod and this model preference has only increased as the\ncollector mustang Market has blossomed.\nBorn on September 20th, 1965, this Mustang has undergone an\nextensive restoration bringing it back to a new found glory with a\nlittle extra muscle versus how it left the Dearborn assembly plant.\nRetaining its original exterior color of Silver Frost and two-tone\nblack and ivory appointments on the interior, the restoration stuck\nto exactly the way this stunning and wildly popular fastback rolled\noff the Dearborn assembly line with the exception of some add ons\nthat will be covered below. Buckle up, grab your lasso and don your\nspurs, we're going to tame this wild pony!\nExterior\nThis car has it all with the fastback styling, vented B pillar, new\nfor 1966 stainless steel rocker molding, hockey stick door and rear\nquarter coves, and 17-inch Shelby style wheels on all 4 corners.\nAll this steel is draped in Silver Frost, and it is looking very\ngood save for a few inclusions, some sanding scratches and areas of\nwavy body filler. All chrome on the bumpers is good, and covering\ntheengine bay is a split scooped fiberglass hood. A look from the\nrear reveals the iconic triple vertical cluster of taillights, GT\nbadged fuel filler cap, an added ducktail style spoiler extending\nonto the rear fenders, and a large curved rear greenhouse glass.\nThe front of the car features the horizontally barred billet style\ngrille fronting sandwiched between single round headlights.\nInterior\nA few liberties were taken on the interior during the restoration\nand we note a change from the warranty tag's 22 code interior\nindicating standard blue vinyl. Very clean looking buckets upfront,\nand a 2 plus 2 rear bench with smooth black bolsters and nice ivory\nhorizontal tuck and roll inserts. This is the Pony interior, so we\nsee the stitched galloping horses on the seat uppers. As an added\nbonus the rear seat folds flat for a little more cargo space.\nRiding the hump is a long armed chrome Hurst shifter with the\nobligatory T-handle and it has great 60's styling. The new for '66\ndash, within a black camera case, holds updated black faced and\nwhite numbered gauges with a center mounted circular speedo, round\nside gauges, and is flanked by a 3 spoke black plastic steering\nwheel. In the center is a digital AM/FM radio and heater slides,\nand on the passenger's side is a black texture finished glovebox.\nBlack carpet floods the floors and is very clean as well as the\nivory vinyl headliner. A shout to the original looking nicely\nfinished correct plaid covered trunk and original looking\nspare.\nDrivetrain\nUnder the scooped hood lies a circa 1978 302ci V8 topped with a\n4-barrel carburetor perched atop an Edelbrock aluminum intake and\nhas a Toploader 4-speed manual attached to the back go of it. All\ndressed up in correct Ford blue along with some polished Ford\nracing valve covers and a chrome lidded air cleaner assembly.\nThings are looking good here but could use a quick detailing to\nbring things up to show level. Rounding out the drivetrain is a\nFord 8\" conventional rear axle weighing in with a 2.80 ratio.\nUndercarriage\nAll extremely clean and virtually no road dirt and only slight\nsurface rust on untreated components. Black undercoating is\ncovering the floors which have had some replacement patches\ninstalled during the restoration. We can see independent coil\nspring front suspension working with a leaf spring rear arrangement\nand power disc brakes all around. A like new dual exhaust system\nfed by headers snakes its way rearward to glasspack mufflers before\nending in turn down tips in front of the rear axle.\nDrive-Ability\nLike I was a kid all over again as my parents had a 1964-1/2\nhardtop version, and I used to stand on the hump as we jetted down\nthe road. Sitting in it brought back memories, and it performed\ngreat, handled the test track swimmingly with all functions\noperating as they should, and had some sweet acceleration! It earns\nits name but it's also fast forward. While Classic Auto Mall\nrepresents that these functions were working at the time of our\ntest drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at\nthe time of your purchase.Here's a classic car you can drive!\nHere we have a restored and highly sought after fastback version of\nthe Ford Mustang. Stepped up a bit from the way it rolled off the\nassembly line and a great combination to boot. If you are in the\nmarket for a moderately priced classic, that starts right up, and\nruns smoothly, this is the car that should grace your garage. Leave\nthe kids at home in front of the TV and enjoy the sound of kid\nsilence, carve some corners and you have nothing but great\nconversation, and a smile on your face.\n6F09C116129\n6-1966\nF-Dearborn, MI Assy Plant\n09-Mustang Fastback\nC-289ci 2bbl 200hp V8\n116129-Sequential Unit Number\nWARRANTY PLATE\nBODY 63A-Mustang Fastback, Standard Bucket Seats\nCOLOR F-Silver Frost\nTRIM 22-Blue Standard Vinyl Buckets\nDATE 20J-September 20th\nDSO 41-Chicago\nAXLE 6-Ford 8\" 2.80 Conventional\nTRANS 6-C4 Automatic\nClassic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and\ncollectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate\ncontrolled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8\nacres!).

        "Gateway Classic Cars of Tampa is proud to offer this stellar 1970\nFord Mustang Mach One. Ford freaks and Mustang maniacs, your\nattention please! If you're searching for a classic Mustang unlike\nany other at the car show then listen up. The legendary Mach One\nMustangs had a variety of engine options, however, for 1970 the\n335hp 428ci Cobra Jet was the baddest on the block. And you may not\nknow, but allegedly the 428s could take a Boss 429 in the stop\nlight wars of the era. According to Ford savant and officially\nlicensed verifier Kevin Marti (martiauto.com), this Wimbleton White\npony is one of one. That's right say it with me, \"One of One.\" 1130\nMach Ones produced in 1970 featured the 428 CJ teamed with the\nbullet proof C6 automatic. Of those units only 125 were white - how\nmany of those are on the road today? Drum roll please....according\nto Marti, this is the only 428CJ, automatic, white '70 Mach One\nwith a special ordered AM radio. I know, but it's still cool to\nhave the only Mach One ever made in this configuration. The\ndocumentation provided by the current owner also could indicate\nthis car was built specifically for a Ford employee of the time. In\nthe last few years, the current owner has installed new exhaust,\nsent the carburetor to Holley for a rebuild, and had the majority\nof the wiring replaced. Here's the bottom line folks, this is a\nspecial car. If you've been waiting for a unique Mustang to come up\nfor sale then wait no further. This Cobra Jet is ready for launch.",

        "1970 Mustang Boss 302 Sportsroof, a 71252 Mile project I first\nfound sitting in 1978. This is a rare classic unfortunately lost\nthe original Boss 302 when the bottom end came apart. Stored as a\ndream for many years after the motor issue it sat until we found it\nand brought it back to life with a running rebuilt .30 over 351\nCleveland with closed chamber heads and all new accessories.\noffered with its numbered 4 speed close ratio toploader 4 speed we\nhad reconditioned including the factory shifter. With our skilled\neffort we have it back to moving on its own again. Equipped with\nthe great options of Power steering and Power disc brakes make it a\ndesirable model as most of these had little or no options. You find\nthe original front end pieces including clean wrap around shock\ntowers as well as the larger sway bar. The original 9 inch housing\nand staggered shock plates are intact with the upper rear brace in\ngreat condition to. Unfortunately the rear center section was\ntraded out many rears ago at which time the 31 spline axles also\ndissapeared and a 28 spline 3.00 we believe was installed and is\nconnected to an original 9 inch driveshaft. As for the body the\nworst first, the cowl is bad and that killed the driver floor and\nlower supports as well. Sorry to say the passenger side is also\ncompromised. An attempt to fill the area where rotted panels were\nremoved the floor panels are lightly installed although we feel the\npatch panels should be removed and replace them with a 1 piece\nfloor pan. Now the better body panel news, the original rolled lip\nfenders are clean and in good shape. The quarter panels and trunk\narea have very little rot with the roof panel also in good\ncondition. The hood and doors will probably need replacing as well\nas front and rear valences and the trunk lid is a 69 so it will\nneep replacing. The trunk floor is OK so thats a plus . This is not\na estimate its a overview so you will be responsible for your own\ninspection.",

From there it began to sit in despair for 20+years\ncollecting dust and whatever else mother nature could throw at it\nunder a carport. Last fall great things happened with his dream as\nhe traded it in on another running 66 Mustang fastback we had at a\nswap meet. After adding quite a few suspension parts we began\nassembling this shell of a vehicle and once it was put together as\nyou see it. To preserve it we added a primer sealer to bring it all\ntogether as we offer it to the market as a good driver quality\nproject. We started this project by removing some damaged panels\nand replacing parts as well as adding pieces as needed. With this\nrare car, we were able to complete the original look and fit by\nusing a mix of new items like fenders, trunk lid, rear window upper\npanel, both valances are some of the aftermarket parts that are\ninstalled. The good news is we have in hand a clear Florida title\nand the complete front clip has all original stamped panels as well\nas the buck or build tag. Being a real fastback the roof assembly\nthe hood, driver's door and many of the Ford installed structural\npanels even the cowl are all Genuine FORD parts too. During the\nbuild the owner added a 1 piece aftermarket floor, rear seat pan,\ntrunk pans and the tail light panel. All the panels while in place\nneed finishing touches and sealing to move forward with a build. I\nam letting someone build it to their standard driver or show its up\nto you. Many more metal pieces like toe pans fire wall and even\nshock towers were replaced and need finishing to be bring this back",

        "1971 Ford Mustang Mach 1 M-Code 351 4V Cleveland! Factory Wide\nRatio 4spd Top loader Decor Interior Fold-Down Rear Seat Rebuilt\nFront Suspension & Steering Rebuilt Rear Suspension Factory Rear\nSway Bar This '71 is a really cool time-capsule from the 80's. From\nthe shadowed hand painted graphics to the super-sexy pinstripes you\ncan feel just how cool this one was on Saturday nights with some\nBilly Squier 'Stroke' playing on the Hi-Fidelity stereo. Air shocks\n& N50's would have been a must, no longer there but you know they\nwere. The 80's were the height of the 351 Cleveland reverence. Huge\ncylinder heads, high compression, big cams, way oversized header\ntubes and good gas still to be had at the pumps. Soon the 90's\nwould come and kill most of the cruising and good fuel forcing\nthese cars off the road. Originally bound for the Utah ordering\ndistrict this Mach 1 spent its life in the dry regions. The floors\nare some of the nicest originals you will see in this breed. There\nis some minor rear wheel well rust to be found thanks to the rural\nnature of its home region, see pics. Overall all though this is a\nvery solid example. Obviously the paint has some age to it with\nplenty of imperfections. There are no obvious signs of significant\ncollision damage. You could easily drive this one as is or a\nrepaint looks like a straight forward job thanks to an original\nmetal body. Inside, the interior has seen some refreshing with new\nseat upholstery, carpet and dash pad upholstery. It really does\nlook nice and shows very little wear. The 'Decor' interior was an\noption for '71 in the Mach 1's so many didn't come with it. Also\noptional is the factory gauge package with center stack gauges and\na tachometer. This Mach 1 started life out as a well optioned\nboulevard bruiser. The M-Code 351 4-Barrel Cleveland was a well\nproven motor with potential well beyond most of its competitors.\nAdd in that wide ratio 4-Speed and a 9' with 3.25 gearing.",

        "Welcome to Street Dreams as we celebrate our 26th year in the\nclassic and muscle car business. When Ford's Mustang burst onto the\nstage in April of 1964, it didn't take very long to realize that\nsomething special was happening. One of the reasons that sales\nsoared to 680,989 units in that first model year was that the\nattractive car could be ordered any way a customer wished. From the\n6 cylinder/automatic secretary's car to a 289 HI-Po V8/4-speed\nK-code corner carver, the Mustang came in many flavors. By the time\nthat this Lime Gold (I) 1967 Mustang came down the chute, a 390 big\nblock was available for the power hungry. Well, a prior owner of\nthis car must have been starving, because beneath the functional\nscooped hood is a real 427 (the race-inspired beast with\ncross-bolted main bearings) that's been fortified with twin Holley\n4bbl carburetors, a 1965 Ford aluminum 2x4bbl intake manifold\n(C5AE-9425-E), a beautiful set of stainless steel headers, a Cobra\ncast aluminum deep sump oil pan, and MSD ignition. Additional\nfeatures include Wilwood 4-wheel disc brakes, beefy C6 automatic\ntransmission, excellent 3 stainless steel exhaust system with\nX-pipe, Ford 9 rear end, subframe connectors, shock tower brace,\ncorrect paint and trim codes (I, 6G), console, AM/FM/Cassette audio\nsystem, beautiful custom wood steering wheel, and fresh tires\n(205/55R16 F, 245/50R16 R) on American Racing alloy wheels.

It had a Ram Air Shaker hood scoop, special\nstriping, and the new-for-'69 styling and was an aggressive car\nwith performance to back up that image.

        "1971 Ford Mustang Mach 1\nDespite having just given the 1969 Mach 1 a facelift with a brand\nnew front fascia in the 1970 model year, Ford already had plans for\na complete revamp in 1971. Much of what made a Mach 1 unique was\ncosmetic in nature while four engine options were available, and\nfive transmission choices were on the list. This generation was\nproduced only from 1971 to 1973 and as we remember, Ford downsized\nthe line with the Mustang II's in 1974.\nFor consignment, a 1971 Ford Mustang Mach 1 wearing black side\nstripes. 36,498 Mach 1's were built in 1971 and while they were\navailable in a variety of colors. Ford chose a Light Pewter\nMetallic example as their cover car on the 1971 Mustang sale\nbrochure.\nExterior\nSingle stage Light Pewter Metallic is a fine shade of satin gray on\nthis big fastback. The honeycomb grille contains inset \"sport\ndriving lights\" and a chrome ring between single headlights. Color\nkeyed bumpers could have been had in '71 but this car retains\nchrome front and rear, both in good condition. Functional dual ram\nhood scoops were Mach 1 specific, and Ford described them as being\n\"NASA type.\" On this car, they are within the wide black stripe the\ncoats much of the hood center and part of a long hood. But it's not\nas long as the flat roof that gently slopes back blending\nseamlessly into the flat back window, past the Mach 1 wing, and\nthen a 90 degree drop onto the vertical rear valance. There we find\nthe honeycomb pattern repeated with a pop open gas cap between two\ntrapezoidal and flush tail lights just above protruding rectangle\nexhaust tips. 15-inch Shelby 10 Spokes wheels are a nice touch on\nthis car as Mach 1's were often equipped with dog dish hubcaps.\nMach 1 Mustang is emblazoned on the front quarter panels. Flaws we\nnote are some chipping paint on the black rocker panel, evidence of\nrepair near a wheel opening, headlight surround, C-pillar, and door\ngap, a ding under the side stripe, various scratches, water spots,\nand imperfections in the paint and stripes.\nInterior\nMolded black plastic door panels feature integral pull handles and\narmrests with woodtone applique' panels. Some of the power window\nbuttons are out of place and the speaker screen is missing. The\ntall front bucket seats include three colors of vinyl, knitted in\nthe center and having accent stripes like suspenders up the middle.\nA tear is noted on the driver's seat bottom and some wear marks on\nthe side bolster at the entry point. The rear 2+2 seats are deep\nand low while the rear shelf is an upright panel with a pair of\nspeakers. A faux wood trimmed center horn section fronts the\nsteering wheels which is wrapped in an aftermarket vinyl grip and\ntextured and molded plastic creates the gauge housing and\ndashboard. This car has the Instrumentation Group option which\nreplaces the clock with a tachometer and a trip odometer is added\nto the speedometer. A trio of gauges is in the center stack, also\nbacked with faux woodtone applique, and containing the aftermarket\nAM/FM/Cassette radio. Vent and fan controls are below the radio and\na clock heads up the center console where we find the floor mounted\nHurst T-handle shifter and when not being shifted, an armrest is\nprovided. Loop style black carpet covers the floor in good\ncondition on the driver's side and shows some wear on the\npassenger's. The black cloth headliner and visors are also in good\ncondition.\nDrivetrain\nClean and driver quality under the long hood, we find the 351ci\nCleveland V8 rated at 240 horsepower. It's tied to a Toploader\n4-speed manual transmission and fueled with a 2-barrel carburetor.\nPower goes to the Ford 9\" rear and power drum brakes are found\nfront and rear.\nUndercarriage\nSurface rust coats most of the suspension components, the exhaust,\nand driveshaft. Oil is seen at the rear differential, the\ntransmission and coated on the oil pan. One bit of flaky rust is\nseen on the belly pan and evidence of welding on a frame rail is\nobserved. Overall, driver quality underneath with no major invasive\nrust other than the noted pan. The dual exhaust travels through\nglasspack style mufflers and out the back via chrome tips. Coil\nsprings soften the independent suspension up front while leaf\nsprings are found in the back.\nDrive-Ability\nThis generation of Mach 1 always feels large, that tall fastback\ngives the car B-52 proportions but driving them and pointing that\nlarge hood towards our test loop is no problem at all. Aside from\nthe obvious blind spot, visibility is good and dual sport mirrors\nwere standard on the Mach 1. Decent power from the 351, and good\nhandling due to stiffer coil springs that were provided on the\nMach. On the downside, we find only that the horn does not work nor\nthe turn signals.\nThe Mach 1 is a legendary Mustang derivative and the 1971-1973\ngeneration might be the most unique of all.

        "1966 Ford Mustang Convertible\nAdvertisements became popular reminders of the Mustang's youthful\nspirit, such as one featuring two mature adults sitting in a new\nMustang with the words, \"Youth is a wonderful thing. What a crime\nto waste it on children.\". It was the car to have it you were\nseeking the fountain of youth. The 1966 Ford Mustang was the car to\nhave if you were looking to win over your neighbor or hit the road\nfor fun and adventure. It was also a must have for enthusiastic\ndrivers and car enthusiasts who simply liked to drive.\nFor consignment, a 1966 Ford Mustang convertible that our consignor\nstates is a smooth driver. This car has a mere 95,765 miles on the\nodometer and this count is backed up by the title, was formerly\nrestored with factory creature comforts such as Ford power\nsteering, an added power brake booster, some snappy dress ups, and\nCragar wheels. It is all looking just fine with this consignment, a\nvery stellar example of what the allure of owning a Mustang was in\n1966.\nExterior\nThe prancing horse works its way across the front horizontally\nbarred grille and is flanked on either corner upfront, a single\nheadlight is recessed into the finned panels directly next to the\ngrille and the body matching headlight bezel. Just below a simple\nchromed shiny bumper is attached, and below this is another body\nmatching panel with round signal lights and a license plate holder\narea. Meanwhile FORD badging races across the hood which goes\nrearward all the while being flanked by the front quarters with\ntheir badging just behind the wheel well. For the well minded\ngapped doors, the beginnings of the hockey stick cove which ends in\nan angled contour on the front of the rear quarter, and now you can\nsee why it is called the hockey stock cove! For this consignment,\nwarranty plate correct Springtime Yellow drenches the body and\nshows with some inclusions, paint pops, bubbling and evidence of\nbody work on the lowers. On top is a nice black canvas convertible\nroof, and surrounding windows sport nice trimmings. The top has\nlight soiling and a slightly hazed plastic rear window. For the\nback, the iconic dual trios of outward V shaped tail lights with\nnice bezels between each V, a centrally located Mustang badged gas\ncap, and dual angle cut exhaust tips poking from the rear valance.\nShiny chrome 14-inch Cragar SS wheels finish off the bottom of this\nbreath of spring air car.\nInterior\nLooking inside one has to wonder if this is the correct interior\ncombination and according to my crack decoder, this is correct as\nper the warranty plate and he says it grows on you. I agree and\nthis warm and inviting Emberglow luxury vinyl is in full bloom\nhere, with said material on the door panels, seats, and headliner.\nAll surfaces present well with some possibly being original to the\ncar. Seats have ivory tuck and roll inserts along with the Pony\nPackage upholstery, (Luxury Interior Package), and smooth\nsurrounding bolsters. Upfront an original dash is seen in black and\nin true Mustang form, rounded gauges with shiny chrome bezels and\nwood applique backdrop, which are in panels created by the dual\ncurved padded bronze dash top. In the center is an AM/FM/Cassette\nradio and the temp sliders. Emberglow carpet floods the floors and\nhas the simple T style shift lever in the middle of the hump within\nthe long and racing ribbed aluminum console that raises up to meet\nthe dash. A shout out to the trunk, where we can see some nice\nplaid vinyl covering the interior of the trunk floor, complete with\nspare tire and jack setup. All fairly clean and presenting nicely\nfor the overall interior.\nDrivetrain\nThe original 289ci V8 takes root under the hood and is in a nice\nengine bay which presents with a slight dustiness and patina with\nsupple wires and hoses. This mill shows in a chipped and faded blue\nand is topped with chrome valve covers and a 2bbl carburetor on\ntop. On back is a correct C4 Cruise-O-Matic 3-speed automatic\ntransmission and power is put to the ground through a Ford 8\" 2.80\ngeared conventional rear axle.\nUndercarriage\nFully restored with glossy black paint on the shock towers, unibody\nrails and flooring repairs that has left this undercarriage rust\nfree and structurally sound underneath. Power steering is noted and\npower hydraulic drum brakes all around. Independent front coil\nspring suspension is on and in back the leaf spring setup is bolted\nto solid steel framing. Underneath door panels at the bottoms some\nrust drippings but no invasive rust seen here.\nDrive-Ability\nMy mother had one of these in this form but a different color, so I\nremember driving with her in it. I've never driven one, so I jumped\nat the chance mostly due to the style and the memories. This car\nstarted easily, and with a short warmup to get her going smoothly,\nit was off to the test track. Here it had nice acceleration, snappy\nsteering, and good braking. All was well with functions too and\nthere is nothing quite like a late summer drive with the top down.\nWhile Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were\nworking at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these\nfunctions will be working at the time of your purchase.\nA good example of this popular car, with nice paint, chrome and\nsome extras. It runs like a champ, has good documented miles, and\nhas been restored to be enjoyed and driven. The color combo is\ngood, and the black top is very nicely preserved. Simple but\nelegant, this car definitely will grow on you.\n6T08C118184\n6-1966\nT-Metuchen, NJ Assy Plant\n08-Mustang Convertible\nC-289ci 2bbl V8\n118184-Sequential Unit Number\nWARRANTY PLATE\nBODY 76B-Mustang Convertible, Luxury Interior\nCOLOR 8-Springtime Yellow\nTRIM 64-Emberglow & Parchment Luxury Vinyl\nDATE 30J-September 30th\nDSO 23-Philadelphia\nAXLE 6-Ford 8\" 2.80 Conventional\nTRANS 6-C4 Automatic\nClassic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and\ncollectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate\ncontrolled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8\nacres!).

        "1966 Ford Mustang Convertible\nHaving only recently been introduced to the public, the first gen\nMustangs seem to have changes made to design aspects nearly every\nyear, some drastic, others subtle. From 1965 to 1966, a few subtle\nexterior items changed included the door scoops which were done\nwith a 3 bar, black and chrome variant in 1966, the vertical bar\nthrough the running horse on the grille was gone in 1966 and the\ngrille itself went from honeycomb design to vertical and horizontal\nbars, and back up lights were standard for 1966 and optional for\n1965, so if you don't see them chances are it's a 1965.\nFor consignment, a 1966 Ford Mustang convertible, driven just 500\nmiles since a total restoration was done to \"showroom\nspecifications\" according to our consignor, and the restorer\nmanaged a body shop at a Ford dealership, so you know specs were\nchecked. Photos of the restoration will accompany this car.\nExterior\nThis hue of sky blue is known as Acadian Blue and it's here in two\nstage form. The familiar face of this classic features the new\ngrille for 1966 and the horse in the corral above a nicely chromed\nfront fender with lower supports that waterfall down on a body\ncolored lower fascia. The tell tale door scoops or faux quarter\npanel vents are affixed at the termination of the body crease\ndetail and the tail end trails off with the smooth, short panels of\nthe rear fenders. Looking at the back reveals an instantly\nrecognizable tail which cannot be confused for any other classic.\nThe triple tail lights, the center gas cap, the body colored\nvalance, and another good showing of a chrome bumper means Mustang,\npure and simple. Our wheels here are 14-inch with wire wheel covers\nand faux knockoffs wearing tires with an early 2021 production\ndate. Up top we have a white canvas top with clear plastic window\nin great condition and with the top down, a medium blue tonneau\ncover finishes the appearance and is also in great condition. All\nchrome and metal work is in fantastic condition. Imperfections\ninclude some apparent panel gap alignment issues and some damaged\npaint in one of those gaps.\nInterior\nVinyl clad door cards contrast dark blue and light blue, showing\nsome discoloration on the lighter part, but the center inserts are\nin very good condition. Two tones are carried onto the seats where\nlight blue surrounds tuck and roll inserts in darker blue, textured\nvinyl and none of the seats, including the back bench appear to\nhave any damage or wear whatsoever. A blue 3 spoke steering wheel\nwith horn buttons on each occupies the column which traces down to\nthe elongated oval dash that houses five gauges including the large\nspeedometer front and center. Over the top a dark blue dash cover\nis sculpted around the radio, in this case an AM/FM unit while a\nbank of four round vents is mounted under the dash in another oval\ndesign. Oval also dictates the shape of the glove box and from\nthere, we note the Mustang T-shifter in the center console on a\nplastic and metal tray base that shows a touch of patina but is in\nfine shape. Blue loop carpet with vinyl inserts occupies the\ndriver's footwell and the carpet continues throughout. A loose\nfitting but period correct plaid mat covers the sizable trunk.\nDrivetrain\nShow worthy clean and tidy, the engine bay holds a 200ci inline 6\ncylinder engine with Ford blue painted parts and clean connections\nand hoses. A 1-barrel carburetor sits on top and a C4 3-speed\nautomatic transmission is mounted behind and sends power to the\nFord 7.25\" rear with 3.20 conventional gears. The car is equipped\nwith power disc brakes with slotted and drilled discs in the front\nand power drums in the rear.\nUndercarriage\nA lovely flat black covers the underside which is as clean as can\nbe. If it was driven 500 miles since the restoration, you certainly\ncan't tell from the underside. There's no surface rust, oil, or\ngrease build up to report, so let's go over the major features. The\nclean single exhaust meets a stock style muffler then terminates\nbefore reaching the bumper and is not visible from the outside.\nSuspension consists of coil springs in the front and leaf springs\nin the rear.\nDrive-Ability\nSmooth surfaces on the inside are quintessentially 60's and it's\nall a bit slick compared to the materials used in modern cars, and\nthat's a big part of the charm. She starts right up and we take a\nlap in this blue beauty where it performs wonderfully. This is\nclearly a cruiser, not a racer, and provides some wonderful open\nair fun with all functions working, save for the horn. With the top\ndown, you'll be able to yell \"Let's go, buddy, the light is\ngreen!\". While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions\nwere working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee\nthese functions will be working at the time of your purchase.\nIt's refreshing to see a 1966 Mustang with the 120 horsepower\ninline 6 still in the car!

        "1968 Ford Mustang California Special Hardtop\nIn mid February 1968, the California Ford dealers began to market a\nfactory built, limited edition Mustang called the GT/CS, or\n\"California Special\". It was born out of the need to spark interest\nin the model as the pony car craze began to blossom and when the\nSouthern California sales manager saw the 1967 Shelby GT500 dubbed\n\"Little Red\" it sparked an idea for a special model that would\nappeal to Californians. The GT/CS was developed alongside the '68\nShelbys and in the end, 4,118 were produced.\nFor consignment, a 1968 Ford Mustang California Special hardtop\nwith a title verified 49,920 actual miles and a 289ci V8 under the\nhood. This one has the black vinyl top and some Shelby stylings\nthat although did not spur the sales numbers Ford was looking for,\nit did create a special Mustang that is collectible today.\nExterior\nCandy Apple Red paint is augmented with black California Special\nstriping that travels the midline and terminates on the rear side\nscoops and also lines the back end of the rear spoiler. In front,\nLucas fog lights live in the horseless blacked out grille while a\npair of hood pins and Shelby style hood vents decorate the top\nsurface. Both chrome bumpers are in great shape and the rest of the\nmetalwork is nice as well. Our notchback has a black vinyl roof in\ngood condition and a California Special script emblem on each rear\nquarter panel. Shelby style tail lights flank a pop off gas cap and\nreverse lights are round units on the rear valance. 15-inch Weld\nDragLite wheels now occupy the hubs and we note one of them is\nbent. Other imperfections include numerous scratches, chips,\ncracking body work, bubbling, some gap fitment issues, and a triple\nscratch in the black stripe.\nInterior\nBlack vinyl door panels have a woodgrain strip inside the pleated\npatterned insert which shows a bit of waviness on the doors and\nsome separation on the driver's side. Low back bucket seats have\ntextured and pleated inserts, all in good condition, and the black\nvinyl continues on the back 2+2 seating where we find one window\ncrank off its mount. A wood rimmed 3 spoke steering wheel shares\nthe column with an AutoMeter tachometer in front of the wood\napplique lined dashboard and standard gauge package. An updated\nMustang branded AM/FM/Cassette radio is in the center and warm\nwoodgrain applique covers the dash in front of the passenger and\nabove the glove box. A Hurst shifter is floor mounted with a rubber\nboot and surrounded by loop style carpet in good shape and a center\nconsole with armrest and cupholders has been added. An overhead\nconsole stretches to the back of the car adorned with more\nwoodgrain applique and the headliner itself looks to be in very\ngood condition. The trunk is clean and painted and houses a fuel\ncell.\nDrivetrain\nUnder the hood is a 289ci V8 with a Holley 4-barrel carburetor and\na T5 5-speed manual transmission sending power to the Ford 9\" in\nback. Disc brakes are found on the rear wheels and drums in front.\nHeaders begin the exhaust process in this clean engine bay which\nfeatures a chrome shock tower brace, Monte Carlo bar and valve\ncovers.\nUndercarriage\nDriver quality underneath with its fair share of surface rust in\nthe usual areas. The dual exhaust enters FlowMaster mufflers after\nan H-pipe and then dumps under the car. The driveshaft runs through\na loop on its way to the back while coil spring suspension is\nemployed up front and a 4 link with coilovers are out back. There's\none spot of invasive rust on the inside rear quarter panel.\nDrive-Ability\nWe'll head west with this one and take the California Special on a\ntest run. The 289 with headers and short exhaust creates a little\nearthquake of sound under the seats and the car rolls around the\ntrack like a mudslide, smoothly. We surf the gears and ride a wave\nof acceleration which is quite good and the brakes stop the car\nlike rush hour on the 405. As far as functionality, the left rear\nturn signal doesn't blink, the reverse lights do not illuminate,\nand the fog lights don't work. Minor dysfunctions from something\nwith California in the name. Everything else worked as intended.\nWhile Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were\nworking at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these\nfunctions will be working at the time of your purchase.\nWhile not fully original, this is a real California Special and\nwhen was the last time you saw one? These are really quite rare and\nuntil tributes were produced by Ford in 2007 and subsequent years.\nWe're thrilled to have one in our Hallowed Halls with low mileage\nand a Marti Report that comes with it. Take the 15 to the 40 and\nhead east to the PA Turnpike, then get off at the Morgantown exit.\nThat's where you'll find us!\n8R01C166268\n8-1968\nR-San Jose, CA Assy Plant\n01-Mustang Hardtop\nC-289ci 2bbl V8\n166268-Sequential Unit Number\nWARRANTY PLATE\nBODY 65B-Mustang Hardtop, Luxury Buckets\nCOLOR T-Candy Apple Red\nTRIM 6A-Black Decor Vinyl Buckets\nDATE 12F-June 12th\nDSO 74-Seattle\nAXLE E- 3.00 Equalock\nTRANS 1-3 Speed Manual\nClassic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and\ncollectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate\ncontrolled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8\nacres!).

Fastbacks were always seen as the more\nyouthful, sporty version of the Mustang and 4 out of 5 car guys\nagree, they're just plain cool, (not a scientific sampling).\nFor consignment, a 1965 Ford Mustang Fastback. It's original\nlooking and wears a beautiful hue of blue. The car has been garaged\nby our consignor who is also not afraid to drive it distances. This\ncar made the trip to Ocean City, Maryland, a three hour trip, and\nto Classic Auto Mall, an hour away without incident.\nExterior\nTwo stage Silver Blue paint adorns the car and helps make the\niconic lines of the car pop. From the recessed waistline cove to\nthe louvered rear quarters, everything is just a bit crisper in\nthis color. The beautiful chrome bumpers, Mustang emblazoned\ngrille, and headlights meld seamlessly with the silver tones in the\npaint, while the taillights and front marker lights explode with\ncontrast. Other metal work including the window frames, door\nhandles, and side mirrors are in fine condition. 14-inch steel\nstyled wheels look great, and the blue Mustang center cap is a\ngreat accent. Imperfections in the paint include bubbling down low,\na touched up S-shaped scratch, also low, some extra paint drip, a\ngap in the headlight surround, evidence of body filler sculpting,\nand general panel gap imperfections.\nInterior\nBlack vinyl door panels with stitched pattern inserts look\nfantastic and clean. The same can be said about the low back bucket\nfront seats, and their silver side molding shining bright. The 2+2\nseats in the back are purposely shaped to allow the back to fold\ndown providing a carpet topped cargo area that is voluminous. A\nwood rimmed steering shines with a lacquered surface and is\ncomplemented by its polished metal spokes. Sliding down the column\nwe find Rally Pac gauges, an optional accessory in 1965 which\nincludes a clock on one side and tachometer on the other. Above it\nthe standard horizontal speedometer is flanked by two round gauges\nin splendid symmetrical synergy. The AM/FM radio is embedded in the\ndash to the right, above a bank of chrome vents. Ford's T-handle\nshifter is floor mounted, surrounded by faded loop style carpet\nthat retains its black color in the footwells. A center armrest has\nbeen added and has the ever important cup holders. The trunk is\nunlined and clean.\nDrivetrain\nUnder the hood, we find a rebuilt 302ci V8 topped by an Edelbrock\n4-barrel carburetor and intake manifold. The presentation is driver\nquality dressed with chrome valve covers and air filter element\ncover. It is connected to a rebuilt C4 3-speed automatic\ntransmission sending power back to the Ford 8\" rear with 3.00\nconventional gears. Drum brakes are situated at each wheel.\nUndercarriage\nDriver quality underneath as well with plenty of surface rust and\nmore concerning rust on frame rails and patterns, along with\npatched panels on the rear torque boxes, areas of flaking rust, and\nseparation. There's a bit of surface rust on the door bottoms as\nwell. The dual exhaust looks great however and flows from headers\nback to stainless steel muffler and then out the back via\ndownturned tailpipes. We also note no leaks or misplaced fluid.\nCoil springs are on the front independent suspension while leaf\nsprings are in the back.\nDrive-Ability\nThe sloping rear window provides great visibility, and we'll gladly\nsacrifice the blind spot for the iconic louvered panel. The big\nsteering wheel provides a great handle and off we trot onto the\ntest loop with the 302 breathing well through headers and dual\nexhaust, and it sounds darn good too! The 302 delivers good power\nand the chassis, a comfortable ride. All functions work as expected\nwith the exception of the tachometer and clock.\nFastback fanatics won't even look at a notchback and we totally get\nit. This is easily in the top 10 designs for the era of pony cars\nand gets a lot of attention. You don't need a 390 car or a Dodge\nCharger chasing you to have fun in the classic and like rain off\nthe back window, these cars stream out of the mall pretty quickly,\nso we encourage you to get on your horse and giddy up.\n5R09A193336\n5-1965\nR-San Jose, CA Assy Plant\n09-Mustang Fastback\nA-289ci 4bbl 225hp V8\n193336-Sequential Unit Number\nWARRANTY TAG\nBODY 63A-Mustang Fastback Standard Interior\nCOLOR K-Silversmoke Gray\nTRIM 26-Standard Black Vinyl Buckets\nDATE 03Q-March 3rd\nDSO 71-Los Angeles\nAXLE 1-Ford 8\" 3.00 Conventional\nTRANS 6-C4 Automatic\nClassic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and\ncollectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate\ncontrolled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8\nacres!).

        "Welcome to Street Dreams as we celebrate our 25th year in the\nclassic and muscle car business. When Lee Iacocca and Ford unveiled\nthe Mustang to an unsuspecting public on April 17, 1964 there were\nsome hints that the new car might be popular, but nobody was\nprepared for the stampede that followed. At least 680,989 Mustangs\nwere sold in its first model year, setting an all-time record for\nfirst-year new model sales and becoming Detroit's greatest single\nsuccess of the 1960's. This beautiful yet potent pony retains the\nclassic styling that set the world on fire while offering immense\nimprovements to its safety, comfort, and performance.

        "ABSOLUTELY AWESOME, SILVERSMOKE GRAY 1964 1/2 FORD MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE, 289 V-8, EXTREMELY ORIGINAL WITH ALL THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION, BEAUTIFUL OLDER RESTORATION READY TO SHOW AND GO!!!!\nIf you have been searching for a truly outstanding, investment quality, Classic Mustang Convertible that is extremely original and also is turn key ready to drive, show off , and enjoy than this one may be the one to end your search! with a production date of August 3, 1964 this is considered a 1964 1/2 early production Mustang. It is titled as a 1965 which is how all of the 64 1/2 card were titled. It was originally sold at Roy O'Brien Ford in St. Claire Shores, Michigan on August 17, 1964 and we have all the cool original documentation including the original window sticker, original sales order and agreement and original owners manual. I bought this car from a gentleman in Michigan who actually owned the car 2 different times and was the 3rd and 5th owner of the car. He originally purchased it in 2003 from the 2nd owner who was in Colorado where the car is believed to have spent most of its early life. He sold the car in 2011 to someone in Wyoming and told them if they ever decided to sell it to let him know. Well, 2 years later he got the call and bought it back from them in 2013 and owned it another 11 years before deciding that it was again time for it to be enjoyed by another lucky owner. I was thrilled to have the chance to buy it and was so impressed with the quality of this car when it arrived here in Alpharetta, GA and I just know this special Mustang Convertible is going to make the next owner extremely happy...maybe you?!!\nAs you will see in the pics and video the body and paint look outstanding with no issues. It was believed to have been treated to a cosmetic restoration shortly before it was sold in 2003 and had one repaint in the correct, original Silversmoke Gray color which is a rare first year color. It looks silver in some lighting and has a silver blue tone at times as well. I have seen and owned quite a few early Mustangs and this car simply shouts quality and originality everywhere you look. The paint and body are close to show quality and I believe it still has all of its original body panels many with original stampings, which are extremely straight and body panels gaps are awesome. You might find a rock chip somewhere but the body is near flawless and this car will definitely win its share of trophies at the shows if that is what you enjoy. All of your chrome, stainless, emblems etc look fantastic. All of the glass, other than the windshield is original Carlite glass. I will provide a photo tour of the body panels and hopefully you will see just how nice this Pony is!!!\nHopefully you will enjoy this Pony convertible with the top down but it does have a black power top that is also in fantastic condition. It goes up and down smoothly and latches down with ease and the windows all seal up nicely. It also has the black boot cover for when the top is down.\nComplimenting the Silversmoke Gray exterior is an extremely original black interior. Very possible that it is still all original and it is in awesome condition throughout. The only flaw I could see was a very small mark on the drivers seat that might have been from a cigarette. Dash pad looks great, carpeting all looks great, original style black rubber floor mats, gauges and bezel look great and everything appears to be working properly. An aftermarket hump hugger center console with cupholders was added but can easily be removed if desired. The original owners manual is still in the glove compartment. An aftermarket Kenwood stereo works well and the dash was not cut. Weatherstripping all looks excellent. You will be proud to show off this interior and find it very comfortable as well.\nThis early production 64 1/2 has what we believe to be its original C-code 289 2bbl V-8. The date code on the block decodes as July 30, 1964 which falls just a few days prior to the cars build date. We believe the car has just a little over 125,000 miles on it and very possible it had a rebuild at some point prior to 2003 as it runs amazing and the internals are extremely clean. The gentleman we bought it from did have the original Autolite carburetor rebuilt last year. This car still has its original 3-speed manual transmission which shifts beautifully and is a lot of fun to drive. Manual steering and manual brakes but do not let that deter you. This lightweight Mustang steers very easily and tight and the brakes are dialed in and stop better than some power brake Mustangs I have owned. It has a very nice sounding dual exhaust. It is riding on a beautiful set of 14\" Styled steel wheels and I put brand new BFG Radial TA tires on that have under 20 miles on them. As you will see we did a nice engine bay detail on this Pony classic so that she will shine and impress when you show her off. Inside the trunk is rock solid with matching spare. Undercarriage also looks great. Appears to have original floorpans with small patches done well on the front floorpans. I cannot emphasize enough just how nicely this car drives at any speed! This is one of those rare opportunities to buy a well documented, very original classic Mustang that was loved by its owners.\nBe sure to check out the video walk around and start up and all the pics to see just how nice this car is!!!\nAsking price is $49,500 and serious buyers can call me at  with any questions. I am also a transport worker and can assist with getting you a great rate on Enclosed Transport anywhere in the country.",

        "1971 Ford Mustang Convertible\nOutside of the 1971 Boss 351, the convertible was produced in the\nfewest numbers. Just 6,121 were created and who knows how many are\nstill roadworthy. Let's just say, this is an uncommon car. As 1970\nmodels were one year designs, 1971 ushered in a new look which\nlasted three years. Then came the 1974's which were met with some\nvocal consternation. In contrast, the '71-'73 retained at least a\nhint of Mustang's glory days.\nFor consignment, a one family owned garage kept 1971 Ford Mustang\nconvertible born in Dearborn, Michigan with a 351ci Cleveland V8\nunder the hood. It presents in good original condition and it's\nultimately restorable if that's the direction the new owner wants\nto go.\nExterior\nOur example is covered in Copper colored paint that shows in used\nbut presentable condition, meaning it has its share of chips,\nscratches, peeling, and surface rust. There's also some bubbling\nnear the rocker panel. Overall however, the panels appear fairly\nstraight with the color change the car is wearing from the original\nMedium Yellow Gold. The chrome bumpers are in decent condition as\nare the metal trimmings, including the window frame. The long hood\nleads into a shoulder line that rises on the rear quarter panel and\nterminates in a vertically flat tail. Distinctive taillights are\nflush with the rear panel and have the reverse light in the center\nof three segments. The 14-inch wheels with Sport wheelcovers along\nwith the white lined tires that surround them keep this skate on\nthe road. The black canvas top seems to be in outstanding condition\nand retains a glass rear window.\nInterior\nGinger is the original interior color code, but it's not ginger in\n2024 terms, meaning orange. It's ginger that's more of a saddle\nbrown with tinges of yellow. The driver's door panel starts the\npalette and surrounds a faux wood panel. This particular door shows\nsome age and will benefit from cleaning and restoration, while the\npassenger door is in better shape. Meanwhile, the panel of electric\nwindow switches on the driver's door is impressive. Moving onto the\nseats, the vinyl bolster and side supports surround a knit center\nand the front buckets along with the rear bench are in good\ncondition while the molded plastic interior trim could use a good\ncleaning or repainting. A very basic but matching steering wheel\nindicates the Mustang's less sporty nature which is also relayed by\nthe simple dash with minimal features. The center stack redeems the\ncar with a trio of round gauges, an AM/FM radio, theheater/AC\ncontrols. A clock fits into the center console ahead of the\nfamiliar Ford shifter. The ginger loop style carpet is consistent\nwith the condition of the car which is intact but showing some age.\nThe trunk is bare metal and houses a steel wheeled spare tire. The\npaint on the underside of the trunk lid is noticeably decent.\nDrivetrain\nCombustion chamber design and intake differentiate the 351ci\nCleveland rated at 240 horsepower. A 2-barrel carburetor feeds it\nfuel while a FMX 3-speed automatic transmission sends power to the\n9\" rear with 3.00 TracLok gearing. Power brakes, disc in front,\ndrums in the back, equip this car. Visually, the engine bay is\ndriver quality but clean, the Ford blue valve covers shining\nthrough and the decals on the blue air filter housing is clean and\nreadable.\nUndercarriage\nGenerally clean and dry underneath with minimal areas of surface\nrust. We do see a bit of oil near the rear differential which looks\nto be the pinion seal. There's some on the frame rails on the front\nbut none on the oil pan. A single exhaust intersects a Flowmaster\nmuffler and then continues to exit out back. It's covered in\nsurface rust, but the gas tank is clean and shiny. Independent,\ncoil spring suspension is found in the front and leaf springs in\nthe rear.\nDrive-Ability\nA tickle of the gas pedal and a turn of the key and we were off to\nthe test loop. 240 horsepower is buffered by the 2-barrel, but\neventually the car gets up to speed and runs smoothly. Power brakes\nwork just fine and on our list of misses, only the A/C is noted as\nnon functional.\n1971-1973 Mustangs in base trim levels have not had their day in\nthe sun yet, but it's bound to happen based on this period's Mach\n1's rise in valuation. And speaking of sun, here's a rare\nconvertible from 1971 with all the bones of a restorable classic\ncar.

Popularly known as \u201cK-code\u201d\u2014in reference to the special letter designation in the VIN of Mustangs so equipped \u2014 the package included a 289 cubic-inch V-8 engine rated at 271 horsepower and a medley of performance items for a whopping $442.60. Except for the $283.20 air conditioning, no other Mustang option had such an impact on buyer\u2019s wallets, which meant that K-code production was understandably low.\nThe car\u2019s solid-lifter V8 was not the average Ford small-block. Inside its over-square, four-inch cylinder bores were high-strength flat-top aluminum pistons. These were linked via heavy-duty connecting rods with strengthened rod bolts to a more robust cast-iron crankshaft with an enhanced front counterweight to maintain high-rpm balance. Each cylinder head had enlarged intake and exhaust valves, while the engine breathed through cast-iron, header-type manifolds and into a standard dual exhaust system. A Special Handling Group helped make the most of all the power with heavy-duty shocks, springs, and a front sway bar.\nThe superlative 1965 Ford Mustang 'K-Code' Convertible featured here is finished in stunning dark Ivy Green over a Black interior with a White power-folding convertible top. This exquisite Mustang convertible was delivered from the factory with the highly desirable K-code 271-hp \u201cHi-Po\u201d 289 cu. in. V8 as well as a four-speed Top Loader transmission and factory air conditioning. This well-optioned, numbers-matching, K-code convertible represents one of the most iconic and desirable examples of American performance, sure to be prized by Ford or muscle-car enthusiast. I personally the investment potential of this iconic model will grow beyond your imagination, offered to the most demanding collector, investor, or enthusiast who desires to own one of the very best!",

New water pump, radiator, radiator fan, radiator fan shroud, Pertronix ignition, Holley 2300 carburetor, power steering valve, and front tie rod ends installed in 2020. All mechanical parts replaced in 2020, for the exception of the upgraded electronic ignition, are genuine restoration parts. I have driven this car only 1000 miles in the 10 years I've owned it.\nFIRST GENERATION MUSTANG PONY PACKAGE\nClose-up image of the \u201crunning ponies\u201d embossment on classic Mustang seatsh\nThe name Ford gave to the Pony Package in 1965 was the \u201cInterior Decor Group.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a name that really suited the Mustang, and owners quickly started referring to it as the Pony Interior. It gained this nickname because of the embossed ponies that were on the backs of the seats.\nThe Pony Package is considered a desirable feature for collectors, and definitely adds value to first-gen Mustangs.\nBased on the Pony Interior\u2019s lasting popularity, it\u2019s surprising it was only offered for two years. Since then, enthusiasts have restomodded their first-gen Mustangs to also have Pony Interiors.\nThe 1965 and 1966 Pony Interior package included the following:\n*Five-dial instrument panel\n*Woodgrain inserts on gauge cluster and glovebox door\n*Uniquely styled glovebox door\n*Molded door panels with Thunderbird-style, pistol-grip inside door-release handles\n*Door-mounted courtesy lights\n*Removable kick panels with carpeting on lower half and stainless trim strip\n*Running horse-embossed bolstered seat upholstery\n*Woodgrain Deluxe steering wheel\n*Vinyl-covered quarter-trim panels (coupe only)\nIf your looking for a 66 Mustang, this is it!

        "1970 Ford Mustang Mach I\nMach is a dimensionless quantity rather than a unit of measurement,\nnamed for Czech physicist Ernst Mach. It quantifies the\ncompressibility characteristics of fluid flow. Got that? All you\nreally have to know is that Mach I is the speed of sound and\nanything above that is supersonic. The 1969 Mustang Mach I was such\na hit that Ford discontinued the GT that year. In 1970, Mustangs\nreceived a facelift that became a one year design.\nFor consignment, a 1970 Ford Mustang Mach I with a massaged 351ci\nV8 engine, Tremec transmission and a Marti report. It's a stunning\ncar and while we can never predict how long a car will be in our\nHallowed Halls, we think this one might be whisked away at the\nspeed of sound.\nExterior\nThere are few birds as deeply black as a raven, and this car wears\nRaven Black in spectacular fashion. Mach 1's always have some black\naccents including the hexagon clad tail piece, wing, and shaker top\nand while it contrasts with other colors, they blend beautifully\nwith our black car. A charcoal hood stripe is coordinated with a\ntail accent where Mach I is displayed in the center. For 1970,\nsingle headlights are flanked by open fins, unmistakable and a\nfavorite of some, and with the recent passing of Parnelli Jones,\nhis 1970 racer is all over the internet and bound to renew\ninterest. And it's hard not to be interested in this black beauty,\nwearing 17-inch polished American Racing Torque Thrust wheels with\nstaggered sized 40 series tires and sporting the only roof\navailable for the Mach I, the fastback, or as it was called in '69\nand '70, the SportsRoof. Dual exhaust tips protrude out the back\nand having been all the way around the car, we could not find any\nflaws to point out.\nInterior\nIn 1970, Ford switched from dark walnut woodgrain trim to dark teak\ntrim and the two are so close, it's often hard to distinguish. But\nthe woodgrain panel is a highlight on the door panels which also\ninclude smoothly sculpted plastic and a carpeted lower, all picking\nup the black grains of the wood. Tall front bucket seats are in\ngreat shape with tuck and roll inserts with a weave pattern adding\nto the texture complexity. Rear 2+2 seats are smaller buckets with\nthe same pattern and the sidewalls and rear shelf are unmarked and\nclean. A tongue and groove wood steering wheel presents to the\npilot with three sport spokes connecting to a Mustang branded\ncenter cap. The faux woodgrain gauge pod contains four circles of\ninstrumentation, and an extra temperature gauge has been added\nbelow the dash. A gaping center section is seamless and smooth and\ntops an aftermarket AM/FM/CD player with AUX and USB capabilities\nunder which we find the climate controls. A clock and Mach I plate\nare housed in another faux woodgrain panel in front of the\npassenger while a Hurst T-handle shifter is in the center console\nwhich also is home to some woodgrain features. Black loop carpet\nadorns the floor in good condition and the black stitched headliner\nis unblemished. The trunk is lined in black carpeted pieces, and a\nfew will need to be reattached in the otherwise clean trunk.\nDrivetrain\nOpening the hood, we find the shaker top over the air cleaner, a\nperiod appearing battery, and Cobra embossed valve covers. This is\na 351ci Windsor V8 with a Comp cams .493i/500e lift, 218i/224e\nduration @ .050 110 lobe separation. A Holley 650 cfm 4-barrel\ncarburetor supplies the fuel, and a 5-speed manual transmission is\nunderfoot. That transmission is a Tremec TKO600 with an upgraded 31\nspline output, 26 spline input, bronze shift fork pads, internal\nshift linkage upgrade, and Liberty threaded front cluster bearing\nsupport. Power is sent to the back wheels and a Ford 9\" rear with\n3.00 gears. Headers lead off the exhaust system and power brakes,\ndisc front, drums rear, bring forward momentum to a stop.\nUndercarriage\nOther than some road spray and the occasional spot of surface rust,\nthe underside is clean and dry. The dual exhaust enters a pair of\nFlowMaster mufflers before exiting under the bumper. Coil spring\nsuspension is used up front and leaf springs in the back. Minimal\ngrease buildup around the grease fittings but otherwise hardware is\nfree and clear of debris.\nDrive-Ability\nShe fired right up with a mighty roar and smoothly shifted into\ngear with plenty of power at your beck and call, we slowly rolled\nit around the test loop to find every function working properly\nsave for the heater blower that didn't blow on the low speed\nsetting. The interior is clean and comfortable and aside from that\nmodern radio, is a time capsule to 1970.\nAn ecology professor once told me ravens are the only bird that\nuses flight for fun, while other birds use it for getting from\npoint A to point B. The Mach I is like a raven, capable of getting\nfrom point to point, but better used for fun. A stunning car with a\none year only design in a desirable color.

        "Here's a thoroughly restored 1966 Ford Mustang Hardtop that's been\ntreated to substantial upgrades and it's now available from the\nMaxMotive Pittsburgh Showroom.

It adds up to 405 estimated horsepower sent through\nan automatic transmission to a 3.54 rear axle. Power front disc\nbrakes bring it back to a stop. Among the brightest reds available,\nViper Red exterior paint works in concert with the red and black\nvinyl interior and the Magnum 500 chrome wheels for a striking yet\nclassic Mustang look. A cowl induction hood was added to direct\ncool air to the open element air cleaner.

        "1965 Ford Mustang Hardtop\nSince it was introduced 4 months before the normal start of the\n1965 production year the earliest Mustangs were referred to as the\n1964.5 model by enthusiasts. Nevertheless, all 1964.5 cars were\ngiven a 1965 standard VIN at the time of production. Production\nbegan in March 1964 and serial number 1, (5F08F100001), was sold on\nApril 14th, 1964 at the George Parsons Ford dealership in St.\nJohn's Newfoundland, Canada. The official introduction followed on\nApril 17th at the 1964 World's Fair. The gentleman whose name will\nbe forever written in Mustang history was Captain Stanley Tucker.\nHe walked into George Parsons Ford and found an all too eager\nsalesman who sold him the car....3 days before the model officially\nwent on sale. The rest, as they say, is history.\nWe honor the service of Vietnam veterans, who at the time of the\nwar, were at the age of buying their first car. Some bought one\nbefore they were drafted, others bought one immediately upon their\nreturn. Many others did not make it home. Here's a veteran who\nbought a yellow mustang before he was drafted. He abruptly sold it\nto his parents and upon his return, for whatever reason, they would\nnot sell it back. Fast forward to 2014 when a loving wife purchased\na car of the same year in the same color to celebrate his\nretirement. We say every car at the mall has a story to tell.\nThat's a good one. Classic Mustangs are some of the most\nrecognizable and popular classic cars that come through our\nhallowed halls, and this one is a fine driver that will elicit\nlooks and conversations for many years to come. Restoration\nreceipts and details will accompany this car.\nExterior\nLooking like a Palomino horse, this Mustang wears Phoenician Yellow\npaint and has a Parchment vinyl roof. This car has the GT fog\nlights inset in the grille and wire wheel hubcaps on 14-inch steel\nwheels. The '65's had the optional reverse lights to the rear\nvalance below the bumper where we also find a pair of chrome tips\non the tailpipe. The black pinstripe along the shoulder line\naccentuates the body lines of the car. The paint, metal trim and\nbumpers, and vinyl top are absolutely presentable, and the panels\nare straight. It has a touch of patina that is a welcome change\nfrom pristine show cars you would be hesitant to drive more often.\nThis one is a driver! Imperfections include some scuffs and\nscratches, chips, some bubbling, and cracks in the paint.\nInterior\nThe black vinyl door panels are immaculate and the vinyl bucket\nseats and rear bench are in great shape. Molded plastic interior\ntrim pieces in the back and in the footwells look great. The\n3-spoke steering wheel wrapped in a vinyl aftermarket grip shows\nsome patina but is complete with Mustang center cap. The gauge\ncluster features a horizontal speedometer to 120 mph flanked by\nround gauges for temp, gas level, and other important information.\nA JVC AM/FM/Cassette radio looks right at home in the center of the\ndash, and a large glove box is positioned under the dash cover in\nfront of the passenger. A standard Mustang shifter takes its place\non the floor, surrounded by black loop style carpet in great shape.\nThe headliner shows a bit of age but is tight and undamaged. Trunk\nis clean and lined with the common plaid mat.\nDrivetrain\nA 289ci V8 is under the hood, fed by a 4-barrel carburetor and tied\nto a C4 3-speed automatic transmission. The engine was factory\nrated at 225 horsepower which was transferred to the rear wheels\nvia a Ford 8\" rear and 3.00 gears with limited slip. Power drum\nbrakes are supplied on all four wheels. We would categorize the\nengine bay as driver quality and original looking with the\nexception, of course, of the yellow Optima battery.\nUndercarriage\nDriver quality under here as well with its fair share of surface\nrust on the leaf springs, rear axle, and other uncoated metal. The\nshock towers have been repaired in the past and photos of the\nwelding are included in the photo set. Things are relatively dry\nunderneath with just a bit of residual oil on the pan but does not\nappear to be actively leaking. The dual exhaust flows underneath\nwhere they meet a pair of stock style mufflers, the exit out the\nback. Independent front suspension with coil springs is noted and\nleaf springs are in the back.\nDrive-Ability\nWe primed the carb and turned the key and the venerable 289 started\nup and sang a sweet song from the exhaust. We headed out on the\ntest loop and checked functionality. Everything seemed to work, and\nthe car ran and stopped well.\nFifty years after original Mustang ownership, this car fulfilled a\ndream for someone. Surely, there are others out there who dream of\nowning a classic Mustang and whether you leave this one as is and\ndrive the heck out of it or take advantage of its great bones and\ndo a full restoration, you'll definitely be the fortunate steward\nof a great car with a moving story that goes with it.\n5F07A253327\n5-1965\nF-Dearborn, MI Assy Plant\n07-Mustang Hardtop\nA-289ci 225hp 4bbl V8\n253327-Sequential Unit Number\nWARRANTY PLATE\nBODY 65A-Mustang Hardtop, Standard Bucket Seats\nCOLOR A-Raven Black\nTRIM 26-Standard Black Vinyl Buckets\nDATE 04H-August 4th\nDSO 23-Philadelphia\nAXLE A-Ford 8\" 3.00 TracLoc\nTRANS 5-4 Speed Manual\nClassic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and\ncollectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate\ncontrolled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8\nacres!).

        "I am the 3rd owner of this car that was originally sold by Smith Ford, Lordsburg New Mexico. It was built in San Jose CA and has been restored from ground up including taken back to bare metal and repainted in the original Silver Frost. The interior has been renewed to original spec. The engine is the original 200 ci straight six that came with the car new. It has been rebuilt to drive smoothly on today's roads and highways in that it has oversize valves with hardened seats to accommodate lead free gasoline. The carburetor has been updated to a Weber dual throat and has headers to breath properly through a 2.25\" exhaust system. The distributor has been updated to a DUI electronic ignition and the plug wires are custom made from Magnecor. It has the original three (3) speed top loader transmission. Two years ago I had Classic Mustangs of Houston add power steering and Classic AutoAir air conditioning. From the outset the car looks mostly like it just came off the showroom and it is anideal cruiser. The car is for show....not go, if you know what I mean. This pony will turn heads and gets attention at car shows. The wheel trims are original with the car and inside the car the original AM radio is still there. Interior wise I have added 3 point seat belts and got rid of the dash pull parking brake for a hand brake between the seats. My son mounted the tachometer on a custom bracketthat he built on a 3D printer that looks like it was always there. All dash gauges have been rebuilt. I no longer drive it. Shesits in the driveway under cover and I'll wash it every now and then and take it along the Seawall to keep it running. It's time for someone else to enjoy it. The body is straight and essentially rust free, however, a little surface rust has popped up here and there but it's not deep. This is a greatcar to take to the next level if you're so inclined. A conversion to automatic would be a breeze and of course there are those who will fit a new Coyote V8 into it. I understand why as I have one in my F150. But in all honesty this is a great Sunday driver that you will need to park away from others when you take it shopping.

The stunning design, vast options lists and various\nperformance options made the Mustang an instant hit and one that\nwould withstand the test of time.\nThe Ford Mustang began production five months before the normal\nstart of the 1965 production year. The early production versions\nare often referred to as \"1964\ufffd models\" but all Mustangs were\nadvertised, VIN coded and titled by Ford as 1965 models, though\nminor design updates in August 1964 at the formal start of the 1965\nproduction year contribute to tracking 1964\ufffd production data\nseparately from 1965 data with production beginning in Dearborn,\nMichigan, on March 9, 1964.\nThe new car was introduced to the public on April 17, 1964 at the\nNew York World's Fair. Body styles available included a 2 door\nhardtop and convertible, with a \"2+2\" fastback added to the line in\nSeptember 1964. A white convertible with red interior was used as\nproduct placement when the James Bond movie Goldfinger was released\n17 September 1964 at its London premiere, where Bond girl Tilly\nMasterson was in a spirited chase with James driving an Aston\nMartin DB5 in the Swiss Alps.\nFavorable publicity articles appeared in 2,600 newspapers the next\nmorning, the day the car was \"officially\" revealed. A four-seat car\nwith full space for the front bucket seats and a rear bench seat\nwas standard. A \"Fastback 2+2\", first manufactured on August 17,\n1964, enclosed the trunk space under a sweeping exterior line\nsimilar to the second series Corvette Sting Ray and European sports\ncars such as the Jaguar E-Type coupe.\nSeveral changes were made at the traditional opening of the new\nmodel year (beginning August 1964), including the addition of\nback-up lights on some models, the introduction of alternators to\nreplace generators, an upgrade of the six-cylinder engine from 170\nto 200 cu in with an increase from 101 to 120 hp and an upgrade of\nthe V8 engine from 260 to 289 cu in with an increase from 164 to\n210 hp. The rush into production included some unusual quirks, such\nas the horn ring bearing the 'Ford Falcon' logo covered by a trim\nring with a 'Ford Mustang' logo. These characteristics made enough\ndifference to warrant designation of the 121,538 early versions as\n\"1964\ufffd\" Mustangs, a distinction that has endured with purists\n1970 model year saw the previous 351W V8 engine options replaced\nwith a new 351 cu in (5.8 L) Cleveland (351C) V8 in either 2V\n(2-venturi carburetor) or 4V (4-venturi carburetor) versions;\nhowever, some early production 1970 Mustangs had the 351W. The 351C\n4V (M code) engine featured 11.0:1 compression and produced 300 bhp\n(224 kW; 304 PS) at 5400 rpm. This new performance engine\nincorporated elements learned from the Ford 385 series engine and\nthe Boss 302, particularly the poly-angle combustion chambers with\ncanted valves and the thin-wall casting technology.\nFord made 96 'Mustang Twister Special' cars for Ford's Kansas City\nDistrict Sales Office in late 1969. The Twister Specials were\nGrabber Orange Mach 1s with special decals. Ford also made a few\n'Sidewinders', which were built in Dearborn, shipped to Omaha, and\nsold in Iowa and Nebraska. They were available in Grabber Green,\nGrabber Blue, Calypso Coral, and Yellow. The stripes came in the\ntrunk to be installed by dealer\nWhilst Fusion Motor Company make a sincere effort to supply\ninformation that is accurate and complete, we are aware that errors\nand omissions may occur.

        "- Note that the price is in euros.\nAll you need is an open road, low gears, high revs and a V8 Mustang Fastback. - Ken Miles\nAnd we can't argue with that. Because you simply cannot hide that smile when you start the 4.7-litre V8! The Mustang was introduced in 1964, along with the Chevrolet Chevelle and the Plymouth Barracuda. All three cars were quickly labelled as 'pony cars'. A name that the mustang immediately drew a line under; this racehorse is anything but a pony. Its American flair, roaring V8 sound and wonderfully soft-suspension suspension are hard to compare with anything else. When the weather is nice, we soon catch ourselves making 'unnecessary detours; definitely not the quickest route home!'\nOur 'Stang' is Wimbledon White and has the black luxury interior. She was fully nut and bolt restored 2400 kilometres ago and her technology was completely modernised at the time. For instance, the engine runs on modern ignition, all four wheels have power-assisted performance disc brakes and the dashboard is partly digital. And for the real enthusiasts among us; a Magnum-5 gearbox, with which you can conquer the prancing horse yourself. If you dare.\nYour Spotify can simply be played through the concealed radio and speakers. No concessions on the 'oldschool' style, but the complete conveniences of our time. She was born in 1965, in Metuchen, New Jersey. One of the three factories where Ford produced its racehorses. This is where her current engine, the 289 cubic-inch V8 block with 'a double barrel carburettor' was assembled. Does sound like a serviceable American Cool Classic, don't you think?",
        "1969 Ford Mustang Convertible\nAds appearing in Magazines in 1969 stated \"Somebody finally built a\nbetter Mustang...We did\", meaning for the past 4 years the Mustang\nhas been the best selling car out there, and finally Ford outdid\nthemselves with the newly designed Mustang for 1969. Clever!\nFor consignment, a 2 owner car that has a few custom touches, some\nstyling cues of a Mach 1, a rack and pinion steering system, 2 tone\nlow back buckets, custom LCD gauges, and the important rebuilt\n351ci V8 with some liberties taken on the performance front. With\nthe build started and finished by our consignor's father, starting\nin 2009 and taking a full 3 years to finish, this car is still\nlooking fresh. Read on, and meanwhile I'll drop the top and get\nready for a heart pounding test ride!\nExterior\nFor 1969 the design was getting more aggressive with deeper inset\nsingle headlights, a more rakish blacked out grille with running\nlights and a surrounding bright trimming, as well as a simple\ncurved front bumper framing the lower valance. The hood is scooped,\nand the top is tan canvas and power actuated top with a plastic\nrear window to add a touch of class to this streetwise no slouch\nclassic. On the back, the Mustang is still utilizing the trio of\nvertical taillights but now they are straightened out and just flat\nprotrusions for the back panel with another thin slightly upward\ncurved chrome bumper below. The Mustang cove is present and\naccounted for showing off with chrome trimmings for the faux air\nscoops on the rear quarter panels. Body colored sport mirrors and\nnice stainless trimmings set off the passenger's compartment\nwonderfully and are all in near perfect condition. 17-inch Shelby\nreplica wheels with faux knock offs are on the corners and are\nwrapped in like new 235/45R17 Kumho rubber.\nInterior\nSmooth black vinyl and tan tweed intertwine on the doors and\ncreates the armrest and houses the window crank and mirror\njoystick. Inside, nice black vinyl bolstered low back buckets with\ntan tweed inserts are fronting the deeply inset dash and 4 spoke\nbillet style steering wheel atop a billet tiltable steering column.\nThe chairs have tuck band roll inserts for the seating inserts and\nbacks and a rear 2 plus 2 seats are configured similarly, and even\nhave the black and tan matching side panels. Within the dash are 4\ndeep set round gauges, now red lit LCD units and covering this up\nhigh is the nicely padded black dash topper. Moving downward from\nthe center of the dash just before the console is an AM/FM/CD\ndigital radio, a later model heater slide controller, and the\ncontroller for the Classic Auto Air system. A black leather booted\nand white ball topped Hurst shifter is riding the black carpeted\nhump and speaking of the carpet, it appears as nearly new with no\nfading or soiling\nDrivetrain\nUnder the hood it is akin to finding a pot of gold and its\ngleaming, only this pot is a rebuilt 351ci Windsor V8. It has a\nmild performance cam and roller tip rockers. On top is an Edelbrock\n4-barrel carburetor feeding the 8 candles through an Edelbrock\nintake. A 4-speed manual Toploader transmission is on back, and the\nrear axle is Ford 9-inch with 3.50 gearing. Just fab with the blue\nwires, ribbed cast valve coverings and chromed bolt ons abounding.\nThe engine is so bright, I hafta wear shades...\nUndercarriage\nSurface rust is noted on typical steel untreated parts, but the\nfloorpans, toe kicks and inner fenders as well as the frame are\nrust free and solid. Some suspension parts have surface rust as\nwell, but all is sound with these. Up front, attached to the\nindependent coil spring suspension is a Unisteer power rack and\npinion steering unit and in the back we note traditional leaf\nsprings. Bringing this all to a halt are power front disc brakes\nand power drums. Dual exhaust with Pypes mufflers is in charge of\nthe mighty exhale and makes for some wonderful mechanical\nmusic.\nDrive-Ability\nThis car is very impressive on the performance end with unlimited\nacceleration, bias free panic stopping, and rail like handling. All\nfunctions were spot on for the functionality save for the AC not\nblowing cold as it isn't hooked up, the horn not tooting, the top\nnot lowering fully, and the hood scoop mounted turn signals not\nflashing. This car is definitely a head turner and that 351ci\nWindsor is pumping up the volume!\nA fine restoration and rebuild with enhancements and all-around\ngood looks retained as to originality. A nice maroon and tan top\ncombo adding some class to the in your face speed this car can\nobtain. A comfy interior in black and tan tuck and roll and\nrectangular panels for extra feel goodness and the rebuilt Windsor\nV8 under the hood doesn't hurt either.

        "1965 Ford Mustang Convertible\nAdvertisements became popular reminders of the Mustang's youthful\nspirit, such as one featuring two mature adults sitting in a new\nMustang with the words, \"Youth is a wonderful thing. What a crime\nto waste it on children.\" It was the car to have if you were\nseeking the fountain of youth. The 1965 Ford Mustang was the car to\nhave if you were looking to win over your neighbor or hit the road\nfor fun and adventure. It was also a must-have for enthusiastic\ndrivers and car enthusiasts who simply liked to drive.\nFor consignment, a 1965 example of the very popular Ford Mustang\nfrom the first yearand in convertible form. A mild restoration was\nperformed in the early 90's years ago, along with a repaint and an\nengine rebuilt to make for one great driving, simply to work on 8\ncylinderpony with an automatic transmission. A driver's driver if\nyou will. Retaining the correct color from the factory, a deviation\nfrom original on the interior, which is clean and basic yet\nfunctional, and a smoothly working convertible top. One of the many\nexamples here donning the halls of Classic Auto Mall.\nExterior\nDriver quality calming Prairie Bronze paint drapes the straight\nsteel rust free panels of this car. A few inclusions and minor\nscratches are seen in a few areas along with a few areas of prior\nbody work noted. Overall shiny and nice, the bronze paint is draped\nover straight steel panels that are minding their gaps to make up\nthe body. Up front, flanking the galloping Mustang badge within\nitscorral and surrounded by added on GT foglightswithin the side\nspears are the single headlights in the faux vented inserts. Like\nnew chrome, correct and very nice badging, the hockey stick cove\nwith the chromed trim on the rear quarter and clean lines running\nthe length of the body. With 14-inch steel wheels\nwearingspinnerequipped wheel covers and thin whitewall radials,\nthis first year Mustang has you arriving in style and class. A\nblack canvas top is on and shows a few tearsand repairs along with\nno rear window, but does move flawlessly up and down with power\nmotion to top this classic.\nInterior\nWith nearly every part of a 1st generation Mustang interior\navailable from a catalog it's hard to tell these days what's\noriginal and what'sreplaced. But I can tell you this, there has\nbeen a color change on this car and the interior before us is\nclean, mean and looking just fine. Black ribbed vinyl door cards\ngrace the textured steel door shells and are dressed with chrome\nfor the cranks. Slipping inside leads our posteriors to a pair of\ntuck and roll and smooth vinyl lowback bomber style buckets, all in\nexcellent condition, nice and tight, and showing no signs of wear.\nA matching bench is in the rear and appears as nice as the buckets.\nBlack carpet, clean and like new, floats this interior and is\nprotected by Mustang embroidered mats up front and holds the chrome\nribbed console on the hump. Within the console is a small storage\ncompartment and a slot for the chrome T-handle shifter to poke\nthrough before the console rises up and disappears into the dash.\nIn front, this dash is all original with the central speedometer,\nand a single flanking circular gauge cluster on either side. A nice\nfactory steering wheel is in front of this dash with the optional\nRally Pack holding a tachometer and clock strapped on right in the\ndriver's field of vision, and as we pan right, a modern AM/FM radio\nis inserted and installed into the center. A note to the trunk\nspace with the plaid vinyl liner, which looks just fine.\nDrivetrain\nUnder the hood we see a rebuilt in the 1990's 289ci V8 that has\nbeen treated to a .030 overbore. It is in a clean black engine bay\nwith the engine painted black and contrasting gold painted valve\ncovers and chrome topped air cleaner to compliment it. On top is a\n2-barrel carburetor and nice supple rubber hoses and no corrosion\ncan be seen under this hood. On back is a non-original C4 3-speed\nautomatic transmission which sends power to a Ford 8\" rear axle\nweighing in with 2.80 gears and TracLoc.\nUndercarriage\nOverall very nice underneath but not without faults and flaws.\nWhile the shock tower bases remain solid and intact, the unibody,\ntorque boxes and inner rockers havesuccumbed to invasive rust and\nwill need repair/replacement in the near future. Drum brakes are on\nall 4 corners, and for the fully redone suspension we see an\nindependent coil spring arrangement in the front and traditional\nleaf springs in the rear. Single exhaust is in stock form and\nlooking good, albeit with some surface rust.\nDrive-Ability\nA very easy starter, and smooth idle during warmup. Off to the test\ntrack, and here at said track, this car performed well with nice\nsmooth acceleration, tight steering, and bias free panic stopping.\nShifting was a breeze with the automatic, and cruising at highway\nspeed proved no problem for the 8 cylinder under the hood. A few\nnotable frowns reared their heads on our drive with those being the\nRally Pack not being functional due to not being hooked up, the\nheater blower not blowing and the brake lights not illuminating\nwhen prompted.\nWith some nice new restored parts on this car it has a touch of\npony class, but is in need of some TLC on the undercarriage. A drop\ntop to enjoy and drive without the fear of a stone chip or scratch\nin a multi-thousand dollar paint job. Money well spent on the\ninterior and engine which all work together to make this car an A\ngrade consignment and an eye catcher/head turner.\n5F08C620369\n5-1965\nF-Dearborn, MI Assy Plant\n08-Mustang Convertible\nC-289ci V8 2bbl\n620369-Sequential Unit Number\nWARRANTY PLATE\nBODY 76A-Mustang Convertible Standard Interior\nCOLOR P-Prairie Bronze\nTRIM 29-Palomino Vinyl\nDATE 03B-February 3rd\nDSO 23-Philadelphia\nAXLE F-Ford 8\" 2.80 TracLoc\nTRANS 6-C4 Automatic\nClassic Auto Mall is a 336,000-square foot classic and special\ninterest automobile showroom, featuring over 850 vehicles for sale\nwith showroom space for up to 1,000 vehicles.

        "Eleanor.....just say the name and any car guy worth his salt knows\nwhat car you are referring to. The unicorn of the 2000 movie Gone\nin 60 Seconds, Eleanor may have eluded capture on the big screen,\nbut this 67' GT500 Eleanor is waiting here at Burnyzz for you! This\nGT500 started out as a vision for a track car Eleanor with all the\nright equipment to make it successful in SCCA road course races.\nWith that in mind, a rust-free shell was obtained from Arizona and\ntaken down to the bare metal as a blank canvas for a muscle car\nmasterpiece. Under the hood went a full-fledged slightly detuned\nfor pump gas NASCAR Cup Series 358CI small block Ford engine from\nNASCAR legend Roush Yates Racing. This monster motor puts out\naround 750hp and revs to 8,000rpm with ease. Thanks to the open\nside pipes this mad Mustang even sounds just like a Cup Car, the\nnoise is simply intoxicating, and you will do anything to get\nanother hit of that exhaust note. All the thoroughbred horses are\nrouted through a Richmond six speed manual transmission with\nhydraulic clutch and run back to a NASCAR spec Ford 9 rear axle.\nNow you can't have all this power without control, so the body has\nreceived extensive stiffening through boxed frame members, subframe\nconnectors welded through the floorboards, and driveline braces to\neliminate twisting and bending forces. A fully fabricated front\nsuspension with Penske race shocks combine with a four-link rear\nsuspension with Panhard bar and adjustable coil over shocks to make\nthis a compliant street car that is just as much at home on the\nracetrack. Brakes are race spec also with slotted, ventilated\ntwo-piece rotors all around with four piston front calipers and\ndual piston rear. In a concession to street-ability, this GT500 was\nfitted with power steering and even air conditioning! Inside this\nmuscle car was lavished with leather covered high bolster bucket\nseats, Dakota digital instruments, center console with cup holders\n(better have a lid!), a real wood steering wheel, and premium\nPioneer sound system. As a nod to safety, this Eleanor received a\nhalf cage and a racing spec fuel cell. In dedication to making this\nEleanor as true as possible to the movie car, it was finished in a\ndark slate grey metallic with two black stripes and all the correct\nfiberglass bumpers, sides skirts, scoops, and lighting. It a fair\nbet to say that this Eleanor would easily show its taillights to\nany of the movie cars in a straight line and would put laps on any\nmuscle car around a road course. This GT500E has is all and then\nsome more piled on top of that. Don't sit by and let this unicorn\nget away, contact Brian at  and make some movie magic\nhappen today!!

        "1966 Ford Mustang Convertible\nThe Mustang name, of course, was born with this car, allegedly\nbecause aviation enthusiast and Ford Executive Stylist John Najjar\nFerzely felt the car resembled a P-51 Mustang airplane. An\nalternate name-origin story suggests that designer Philip Clark\ncame up with it in reference to the wild horses he saw on a\ncross-country trip. The horse angle, as opposed to the plane angle,\nis the one that stuck in the end.\nFor consignment, the results of a 5 year journey after picking up\nthe car from the previous owner. Our consignor has not only\nfinished the job but done a bang up job with plenty of attention to\ndetail, utilizing various expert shops for different steps of the\nrestoration, and now you have a turn key ready to enjoy, ready to\nshow 1966 Ford Mustang. Oh and I need to mention a consignor stated\n302ci V8 is now under the hood.\nExterior\nWhile performing the exterior restoration, and in lieu of cutting\nout rust sections and welding in new, their theory is to replace\nany panels completely. This was done to the tune of front quarters,\nboth wheel houses, drop downs, full rails, and new bumpers and\nhardware all nice and shiny. Doors, hood, and trunk are new\ncar-like with laser straight panels and well minded gaps that are\ntighter than when it rolled off the factory floor. Primed and block\nsanded twice then finished with a near perfect coat of the Rangoon\nRed. All is also well with the trimmings as in badges, bumpers,\ngrille, window surrounds, rockers, and light bezels. The black\npower canvas convertible top was replaced a few years ago and shows\nnicely, very clean and no rips or tears. Bringing up the rear are\nthe triple V tail lights, an inset shiny bumper, and dual exhausts\npeeking through the rear roll pan. Sporty 14-inch styled steel\nwheels are wrapped by raised white letter rubber in 205/70R14 size\nfrom the 30th week of 2012.\nInterior\nThe interior presents with low back buckets in black vinyl with a\nfront bench seat bottom and bucket backs, hiding the hump with a\npadded armrest. Like new black carpeting is showing throughout, and\nthe rear bench is just like the front buckets and very clean. Up\nfront the dash was stripped and sanded then repainted black with a\nnew dash pad installed. A nice long oval black textured panel is\nhousing the round gauges which are lined up perfectly, and have\nbeautiful near immaculate shiny bezels and chromed plastic framing\nencircling the oval. Like new door panels also in black vinyl sport\npristine handles and cranks. A digital radio which fits nicely into\nthe original radio space is in the center of the dual eyebrow cowls\nseen on either side. The steering wheel fronting the dash has\ndrilled chromed ribs, and has a black plastic edging. On the hump\nis a shiny T handle automatic shift lever. Just an overall showroom\ncorrect and beautiful presentation.\nDrivetrain\nPrior to the body restoration, the original engine was pulled, and\na consigner stated 302ci was inserted. Meanwhile, a full on\nrestoration of the entire bay was performed. We now have a\nbeautiful blue painted valve cover and block mill. It is topped\nwith a single 2 barrel carburetor, and there is a 3-speed automatic\nC4 transmission on the back. The rear is now a Ford 8 inch\nversion.\nUndercarriage\nFormer, (emphasis on FORMER), rust was remediated with a weld in of\nnew floor pans several years prior to the body restoration. There\nare independent coil springs upfront, and leaf springs oil back.\nPower disc braking is on the front and power drum braking is on\nback. A stock exhaust is snaking its way rearward preparing for the\ndual exit. Exhale heavily!\nDrive-Ability\nWith an example of this quality we were looking closely for any\nfaults and on the mechanical end the car fired right up and on the\ntest track ran good, but noticed it runs just a little rough. There\nwas a slight rotational grinding noise from the rear axle and the\nheater blower did not blow. Otherwise a great driver with a smooth\nup and down power top.\nAlthough not totally original, it is a car that can show up to a\ncontest and take prizes with one hand tied behind its back. Miles\nof Rangoon paint, some new panels, larger engine, and nice\ninterior. We can lower the top, and we're off like a prom\ndress!\n6F08C398564\n6-1966\nF-Dearborn, MI Assy Plant\n08-Mustang Convertible\nC-289ci V8 2bbl\n398564-Sequential Unit Number\nClassic Auto Mall is a 336,000-square foot classic and special\ninterest automobile showroom, featuring over 600 vehicles for sale\nwith showroom space for up to 1,000 vehicles.

        "1965 Ford Mustang Fastback\nHere at Classic Auto Mall, we find all kinds of creations coming\nthrough the door. In fact the famous saying among us Motorheads is\n\"you never know what's coming through the door next!'. This is a\nperfect example of a modified customized car that has been taken to\nthe next level in power and looks. Gotta love those shade tree\ntinkerers!\nFor consignment, a consignor stated, (and it is true), \"highly\nmodified\" 1965 Mustang Fastback. Built with speed in a straight\nline in mind, we can see some of the mods on the exterior with the\nbig rear wheels and tires, but most of the work is within the\nconfines of the engine bay and undercarriage. Also with safety in\nmind a roll bar has been added inside along with custom seats.\nBoogity Boogity Boogity...lets go racin' boyz !\nExterior\nAt initial glance we think we are looking at a mild mannered\nRangoon Red painted 2 door Mustang Fastback from 1965 and you may\nsay our decoder's favorite thing to say...MEH! However, upon closer\ninspection, we can see most of the factory fastback charm has been\nretained whileadding some kick ass curb appeal into the mix. The\ngrille retains its chrome 4 bar trimmings and galloping corralled\npony badge just like it did from the factory. OK you may say, but I\ncan still see the hockey stick trimmed cove and louvered quarter\nglass on the sides, bumpers in chrome and trimmed windshield car I\ncan get from the dealer. To that end I'd reply OH CONTRARE'! A\nsnorkel style hood scoop has been added for that period perfect\nracer looks and the rear wheel wells have been massively tubbed to\naccommodate the 15-inch Centerline wheels wrapped in 31x14.5x15LT\nslightly treaded Mickey Thompson ET Street rubber. On back, the\ntriple tail lights remain, however the rear roll pan is fully\nsmooth and would normally be where the dual exhaust would normally\nexit. Upfront the suspension has been lowered to give the car the\ndrag racing rake, and on front 4 lug 15-inch Centerline solid\nwheels are wrapped in 27x4.50-15's. Large side pipes now exit stage\nright and left just prior to the rear wells. I now give you a\nreceipt horse!\nInterior\nInside a multi-point red steel pipe roll cage has been added in,\nthe rear seat removed, and now dual racing buckets with harness\nseat belts keep the driver and reluctant passenger firmly\nentrenched in the seats. Fairly clean black carpet floats this racy\ninterior and on the center the hump is now a B&M shifter. The\ninstrumentation is factory original and a small black rimmed rally\nstyle steering wheel is perched atop the column that comes with an\nAutoMeter tachometer strapped on. Dash central holds the chrome\nheater slides, the factory AM radio and a few added toggles and red\nlights. The trunk, where a fuel cell resides along with the battery\nbox, is sprayed with texture paint looking a lot like trunk liner\npaint.\nDrivetrain\nThe hood now is fully lift off and when removed reveals the\ncompletely custom engine bay. Here we can view the front suspension\nas well as the wheels and brakes, but the shining star is the dark\nblue painted 460ci V8 strapped between the frame rails.On top is a\nchrome air cleaner assembly which resides over a 4-barrel\ncarburetor. On the back is a C6 3-speed automatic transmission, and\nway back is a Ford 9-inch rear with shortened axles. Fairly clean\nexhaust manifolds and chrome Edelbrock badged valve coverings are\nto either side of the engine.\nUndercarriage\nAll I can see is wide rear tires! But I digress as there is no\ninvasive rust, just custom fabricated tubs and panels which house a\ncompetition fuel filter and pump, hard piped steel lines, coil over\nshocks, and Flowmaster style free flow exhaust exiting at the\nsides. Disc brakes are on front, and drums for the rear, we can\nnote ladder bars added in with the rear coilovers for the\nsuspension, and independent coil springs in Mustang II format are\non for the front.\nDrive-Ability\nThe MEH guy took her for a spin and indeed it did just that with\nthe rear tires. Neck snapping acceleration, smooth shifting and it\nwill go faster than we wanted to try to go on our test track.\nHandling was nice, and braking good and solid for when you smoke\nthe competition and you need to throw out the anchor. A host of\nissues crept up during his drive with the wipers, turn signals,\nbrake lights, horn, radio, and heater blower all being\ninoperable.\nAn interesting build to say the least, and now able to go fast in a\nstraight line, all looking the 1965 Ford Mustang Fastback part of\nthe brainchild from Lee Iacocca. A wildly popular pony now turned\nthoroughbred racer.\n5F09C337301\n5-1965\nF-Dearborn, MI Assy Plant\n09-Mustang Fastback\nC-289ci 2bbl V8 210hp\n337301-Sequential Unit Number\nClassic Auto Mall is a 336,000-square foot classic and special\ninterest automobile showroom, featuring over 850 vehicles for sale\nwith showroom space for up to 1,000 vehicles.

Especially when this V8 drop-top cruiser seems to have spent extra time working on showcasing its vintage appeal. The Ford Mustang is the true definition of a Red-Blooded American Classic. It was given a floor, frame, sheet metal restoration and a re-spray later in life (late Eighties) invoices and pictures as documentation. Exterior paint has that high gloss 'wet look' in the light - exactly what you want on a sunshine-friendly V8 convertible.\nPlus, the CODE Y Dark Moss Green goes nicely with the more aggressive features of the 1967 model. The larger front overhang, deeper rear fender vents, and the concave rear gave this model a much more substantial look. The bright work is quite nice with investments in places like the grille, bumpers, bezels, handles, emblems and the correct full disk 14\" correct 21 slot wheel covers keep shining brightly.\nThe White vinyl folding roof has a timelessly attractive look against the Dark Green paint, and with the flip of a switch, it powers down to reveal a Parchment with Black (dash pad and carpet) appointments interior. Just like the paint, it was given a restoration later in life. And today it still has a clean Classic look throughout.\nPlus, there are more classic details here to impress, like the New Repro Mustang Pony emblem floor mats, factory AM/FM Stereo radio. You will also enjoy this one because its nicely done for the driver. Vinyl bucket seats, a center floor console, and crisp gauges set in the dash. All four factory Parchment Deluxe seat belts. Plus OEM Matching Parchment OEM top boot w/bag. OEM scissor jack w/OEM wrench, and a car cover w/bag.\nThe Under the hood is the original Ford powerful 289 cubic-inch 200 HP V8 has been well maintained and has less than 116,000 documented miles (certified compression test revealed as follows all 8 cylinders are documented to be within 10% of each other), engine has a fresh completetune-up and it fires up with the kind of readiness that tells you it wants to hit the road. Equipped with the original cruse-a-matic three-speed Automatic Transmission, Power steering, Power brakes (front discs), and rare factory Air Conditioning (not working at this time), but all A/C components are factory installed and on the vehicle. This Appreciating Classic is a solid cruiser. Complete with documented work invoices, pictures, and Owners Manual. This is the iconic Mustang V8 powered drop-top cruiser with a ton of vintage appeal.

        "1967 Ford Mustang Shelby Cobra GT 350 The current owner has owned\nthis for over 20 yrs. It has had a full nut and bolt rotisserie\nrestoration performed by his shop 14 years ago. The car was built\nin San Jose California and sold by Marv Tonkin Ford in Portland\nOregon. It was bought by a gentleman in Vancouver, Washington for a\ndriver-car going to college. He ordered the car with black exterior\npaint but when the car came in it was Dark Moss Green. The salesman\nsaid take it or leave it, so he purchased the car and took it to a\nlocal paint shop to have it painted black. So it ran around for\nyears as being a black car. The current owner did do a DMV title\nsearch to find the history of ownership and believes he is the 7th\nor 8th owner. So here is a quick run down of the car. This car was\nthe 2199th car produced by Shelby American. The close ratio 4-speed\ntransmission is original to the car and is #s matching, clutch is a\nSACS unit from Germany and the flywheel is of billet steel. The car\nwas originally a hub-cap car but the Magstars were an option. The\nMagstar in the trunk is an original and has never been on the\nground. The NOM 289 Hi-Po engine is date coded correct and has some\nmodifications such as a 20 overbore with Probe Pistons, Eagle H\nbeam rods, a roller rocker top end, and of course mechanical\nlifters. NO, it does not have valve cover spacers to allow for the\nroller rockers. The horsepower is approx. 350. Carburator is the\n715 CFM. Intake manifold is the original. All of the original\ninternal parts ie, pistons-rods-timing assembly, hatchet counter\nweight, flywheel and so on will stay with the car. Rear end is the\noriginal 9' with 3:89 gears but the current owner did add a\ntraction loc to it. Again, he has all the original parts. Exhaust\nsystem is not original and has Magnaflow mufflers, tips are\noriginal but re-chromed. All of the chrome ie: door handles, front\nand rear bumpers etc. are OEM not aftermarket. Rear seat upholstery\nis original.",

        "1967 Ford Mustang Rust free needs to be prepared for paint, also\nneeds interior restoration.Project car: 1967 Mustang Coupe. UPDATE:\nCar has been stripped to bare metal, treated in Osphos metal prep,\na rust neutralizing professional paint product for treating bare\nmetal before painting! After it was treated, it was spray painted\nin a Bare metal primer! It is now ready to repair the few small\ndents, do final prep work and apply the final paint job. The car is\ncurrently priced as it sits, in primer and awaiting final body prep\nand paint. If not sold before it can be scheduled with the paint\nshop, then It will be painted the original Lime Green Metallic\ncolor. If it is painted, the sales price will go up Details about\nthe car: This Mustang is about as rust free as they come, no\ncollision history and very straight. Original doors and trunk lid\nare in very nice condition. The hood has been upgraded to a turn\nsignal style hood with working signal lights! I recently repaired a\nfew floor sections that were thin, put in a small lower rear\nquarter patch and replaced the battery apron and battery tray. All\nthe work is done correctly and professionally! The car has been\nsanded down to bare metal and had a phosphate wash applied. It will\nneed some minor body work for some small dents and dings before\npainting. I have assembled the car with nice original parts and\nlined up the sheet metal. This car has the 200CI factory original 6\ncylinder engine and a 3 speed straight drive transmission. It is in\ngood running shape, fires right up when cold and has no known\nissues! The tires. exhaust, brakes and shocks were replaced but the\ncar has been in storage since 2010 and these components should be\ninspected before road use. All glass and glass trim is included.\nThe interior has been stripped out and the seats have been\nreinstalled for transit. Great project to finish and drive at the\nsame time. It will be sold with a clear NC title Please Note The\nFollowing **Vehicle Location is at our clients home and Not In\nCadillac, Michigan. **We do have a showroom with about 25 cars that\nis by appointment only **Please Call First and talk to one of our\nreps at  EXT 1 **",
