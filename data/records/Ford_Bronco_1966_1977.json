        "Looking for a project or you and your kids or grandkids? This 1965\nFord Bronco more than fills the bill. This project does start, run\nand drive around a parking lot. Note: The brakes do not\nfunction.\nMade in Ford's Wayne Michigan assembly plant in August 1965, this\ncompact sport-utility vehicle is dressed in white over Sahara Beige\n(code H). The paint and trim are in satisfactory order, while the\ncar's bodywork is straight. The chrome bumpers fit tightly to the\nbody but are in similar condition to the rest of the vehicle's\nexterior. The hinged windshield folds down. This is a very early\nproduction number of the first year bronco was offered.\nThis Bronco rolls on a mix of radials, size 275/75R15 at all four\ncorners. The truck has no wheel covers, just steel wheels with\nfront locking hubs and Equa-lock axle. There is a full-sized spare\ntire in the back. The tires and wheels are all in poor condition.\nIt rides on a 92-inch wheelbase and has a 3,900 GVWR.\nFor 1966, three Bronco body configurations were offered, including\na two-door wagon, a half-cab pickup and an open-body roadster.\nUnder the hood is a 170 CID 12-valve straight six-cylinder engine\nbacked by a floor-mounted three-speed manual transmission and a\n3.20:1 rear end. To lower production costs, at its launch, the\nBronco was offered solely with a three-speed, column-shifted manual\ntransmission and floor-mounted transfer case shifter. To simplify\nproduction, all examples were sold with four-wheel drive; a\nshift-on the-fly Dana 20 transfer case and locking hubs were\nstandard. The rear axle was a Ford nine-inch unit, with a Hotchkiss\ndrive and leaf springs; the front axle was a Dana 30. The vin plate\n(detached) does match the vin stamping on right front frame\nmember.\nInside, the truck's front buckets are in poor shape, there's no\ncarpeting and the headliner is in similar shape. There's an\noriginal two-spoke steering wheel framing the original dashboard.\nThe original inner door liners, the dash and steering wheel are all\nworn out. A factory AM radio completes the interior.\nThe idea behind the Bronco began with Ford product manager Donald\nN. Frey in the early 1960s (who also conceived the Ford Mustang)\nand was engineered by Paul G. Axelrad, with Lee Iacocca approving\nthe final model for production in February 1964, after the first\nclay models were built in mid-1963. Developed as an off-road\nvehicle (ORV), the Bronco was intended as a competitor for the Jeep\nCJ-5, International Scout and Toyota Land Cruiser. Today a compact\nSUV in terms of size, Ford marketing shows a very early example of\npromoting a civilian off-roader as a \"Sports Utility\" (the two-door\npickup version).\nCompetition to this Ford in 1966 included Jeep's CJ-5,\nInternational's Scout 800 and Toyota's Land Cruiser.\nIf you like restoring 4x4 vehicles and you've never had a\nfirst-generation Ford Bronco in your garage, this is your\nopportunity to restore one. Visit MotoeXotica Classic Cars today to\ncheck out the foundation this Bronco offers for you to either\nrestore to showroom new or take it in a totally different\ndirection.\nVIN: U15FL733163\nThis truck is currently located at our facility in St. Louis,\nMissouri. Current mileage on the odometer shows 98,635 miles. It is\nsold as is, where is, on a clean and clear, mileage exempt title.\nGET OUT AND DRIVE!!!\nNote: Please see full terms and conditions listed below that\npertain to the purchase of any said vehicle, thank you.",

Under\nlong-term enthusiast ownership for the last decade, this truck\nunderwent a restoration four years ago which included a\nhigh-quality repaint, all new interior and many mechanical\nupgrades. Finished in dark blue with a black soft top, paint is\nvery nice over a straight and solid body. Bumpers, seals and badges\nwere replaced and the quarter vent windows in the doors were also\nrestored (an often overlooked detail). 15-inch chrome steel wheels\nare wearing BF Goodrich 33x12.50 all terrain tires, along with a\nfull-size matching spare on a heavy-duty bumper-mounted swing-away\ntire carrier. The black soft top with tinted (and removable)\nwindows is brand new.\nInterior presents beautifully with custom high-back bucket seats\nwith a fold-and-tumble rear seat tastefully finished in brown\ndiamond-stitched leatherette. Door panels, rear quarter trim\npanels, dash pad and armrest are upholstered to match. The locking\ncenter console provides two adjustable cupholders, secure storage,\nand houses a modern bluetooth stereo. A custom family-style roll\ncage affords three-point seat belts for both the front and rear\noccupants. All gauges, switches and lights are, of course, working.\nAn attractive wood-rimmed steering wheel fronts a new chrome-plated\ntilt steering column. Windshield wipers have been converted to a\ndual electric motor setup for reliable operation without any clunky\nlinkages.\nUnder the hood is a 351 cubic inch \"Cleveland\" V8 mated to a\nfive-speed manual transmission and a twin-stick dual-range transfer\ncase. The engine has been upgraded with Holley Sniper electronic\nfuel injection along with electronic ignition (the digital display\nfor the EFI system is discreetly mounted inside the glove box).\nOther options include power steering and power brakes with\nfour-wheel disks, plus a VintageAir heating and cooling system\nwhich integrates heat, defrost and a/c into a single set of\ncontrols. Suspension components were all renewed four years ago,\nincluding Bilstein shocks and a two-inch lift.\nThis Early Bronco runs and drives great and is certainly a head\nturner wherever it goes.

        "Welcome to Street Dreams as we celebrate our 26th year in the\nclassic and muscle car business. Product manager Donald Frey and\nengineer Paul Axelrad would probably be shocked at the current\nmarket prices asked for the first generation Ford Broncos that they\nhelped create. A quick look at Hemmings' current listings for first\ngeneration Broncos will have many examples priced above $100K. That\nis indeed a long way from its humble beginnings as a moderately\npriced competitor for the Jeep CJ-5 and International Scout. This\nhandsome Dark Jade Metallic 1977 Bronco is a fine example of these\ncoveted and capable classic SUV's. Lift the hood and you'll see\nFord's venerable 302 V8 that keeps its cool thanks to an aluminum\nradiator, an aluminum water pump, and a nice 6-blade flex fan.\nAdditional features include power steering, power front disc\nbrakes, air conditioning, automatic transmission, 3.50 rear end, HD\ntubular front radius arms, dual fuel tanks, lockable console strong\nbox with Pioneer AM/FM/CD audio system, external spare tire\ncarrier, and beefy tires (32x11.50R15LT) wrapped around chromed\nsteel wheels.

        "1972 Bronco, original Paint 41k miles. One owner Bronco from Pocatello Idaho until 2017 when it was sold to the second owner who lives here in Tucson. He had it consigned at a local dealer who I purchased the car from. One of only 792 produced in \"Calypso Coral\" paint code. The paint is all original with the exception of the passenger front fender that had a repaint back in the 70's. Still shines beautifully but does have nicks, dents, chips, and scratches from its 60 years of existence. 41,000 miles believed to be original but not noted on title.\nAll original Drivetrain that has only been serviced and resealed as needed. Recently I upgraded the front drum brakes to a Wilwood 6 piston Disc brake with power assist. I was able to utilize the original hubs. I upgraded the suspension with a \"wild Horses\" 2-1/2\" lift kit. Very nice progressive springs that ride ultra smooth. I installed Bilstein Shocks on all 4 corners and added US Mag 5 slots with 30x 9.5 15 BFG All Terrains. Great stance. Transmission is the original 3 on the tree manual. Differentials are factory 4.11 gear.\nThe interior was originally white but needed replacement. Seats were redone in Black with houndstooth inserts. The floors were fully insulated and covered in custom fitted German Square weave carpet. I added a Retrosound stereo that has bluetooth with Mic for phone calls with Infiniti speakers. there are also two USB plug ins. An all new Vintage air AC and heat unit was installed that makes driving in the summer much nicer.\nIts nearly impossible to find a Bronco in such original unmolested condition. Ive kept the original Brakes, springs, heater box etc just in case anyone wanted to bring her back to stock.\nVehicle is Listed Locally and in other advertising outlets and we reserve the right to end this listing at any time.\nWorldwide shipping available, please email me for a Quote.\nMore Pictures and FINANCING available on my website www.TucsonClassics.com Thanks!

        "1972 Ford Bronco\nThe Ford Bronco has returned, introduced in July of 2020 and it was\nnot alone. Not one but two new Broncos will debut this year,\nfollowing up on a legacy that stretched from 1966 until 1996, when\nthe last big Bronco rolled off the assembly line. In its 30 years,\nDearborn's rugged 4x4 changed with the times, laying the foundation\nfor the SUVs that took over the range in the 1990s. Also, fun fact:\nThe carburetor of the Bronco featured special floats to battle fuel\nflooding or starvation during off-roading in steep terrain. A\nnumber of other systems were beefed up to make it able to handle\nitself off-road, including a larger oil pan and a more capable fuel\npump.\nFor consignment, a generation 1 version right out of 1972 as a 3\nowner rig with 53,010 title verified miles. This vehicle lives up\nto its name as it is unbroken on the acceleration front, and a full\npress of the accelerator and it is off like its namesake, we give\nyou the 1972 Bucking Bronco. Redone in 1988 and given a new\nfiberglass body and including a pickup truck body should you want\nto change things up a bit, all looking sweet in its off roading\nready black hue, nifty wheels, lift kit, and all maintenance\nattended to as needed. Saddle up!\nExterior\nStep right up and shake hands with the paint which is a beautiful\nand menacing black hue, this off road dweller is looking just\npretty nice with well minded gaps throughout but does have chip off\nrevealing turquoise underneath along with dry spots in the finish\nand some inclusions in various areas. In nice contrast the chrome\ntrimming on the black painted grille with its simple round\nprojector headlights on either side and a thin but effective shiny\nchrome bumper below. All panels are straight including the hood\nwith its custom integrated functional hood scoop and Mack bulldog.\nOur example comes complete with a removable black canvas top for\nall your open air adventures and presents in clean condition with\nno tears. With a windscreen that can tilt forward for unlimited\nviews, and a roll bar just in case an errant wave puts you wheels\nup, you will be protected. Tinted glass all around on the soft top\nand a tailgate that has a small storage area upon opening it along\nwith a rear seat. Another nicely trimmed thin bumper below and dual\nexhaust pipes which are peeking out the bottom with angle cut tips,\nit's ready for the race. 15-inch highly polished chrome wheels\nwrapped in 31x10.50R15LT rubber on all 4 corners will get you\nthrough the wettest sand the coast has to offer.\nInterior\nKeep it simple would sum it up for this wild ride as we saddle up\nand climb aboard. We perch on new black vinyl buckets passing black\ndoor panels on our way inside. Up front is an original dash with\njust the facts ma'am, on the instrument front, a single circular\ngauge cluster for this fine equine along with the addition some\nwood applique give the dash an air of class. Installed within the\ndash is an AM/FM/Cassette stereo and a few added emblems for good\nlooks. The dash front is topped by a near perfect black padded\nvinyl topper and fronted by a 3 spoke Grant GT steering wheel. Your\n4-wheel shifter and transmission shifter, both courtesy of Duffy's,\nis on the center on the floor. Near perfect black rubber carpeting\nfloods the floors in the front and rear. A black vinyl bench in the\nrear provides room for 2 more and there's room in the way back for\nyour beach blanket, grill and cooler. The surrounding paint and\ninterior surfaces are all in nice condition.\nDrivetrain\nThey say never look a gift horse in the mouth, however we here at\nClassic Auto Mall with our inquiring minds pay no attention to this\ntheory so we pop the hood and are met with a pleasant surprise! 302\ncubes, original and unmolested, all bathed in patined Ford blue\nrests in the unrestored bay. Chrome valve covers offset all the\npatinafinish and air cleaner assembly hides the 2-barrel carburetor\nunit underneath. This mill is aligned with the 3-speed manual\ntransmission that sends power to a 9\" Ford rear axle and if you\nhappen to get mired down in the surf a Dana 44 axle is on the front\nto get you back on your way. A shout out to thered ignitionwiring\nand hose covers throughout the bay.\nUndercarriage\nUp on our lift we can inspect the belly of this beast and we note\nsolid full frame construction, light rust, and all looking simple\nand good to go. Trailing arm and coil springs for the front\nsuspension, and leaf springs for the rear combined with a 2-inch\nsuspension lift kit help you traverse and dunes you may come across\nwith new shocks and bushings installed. 4 wheel drum brakes along\nwith power steering and a dual FlowMaster exhaust to produce a\nrobust engine sound as you take her roaring down the beach.\nDrive-Ability\nThe black called me and I had to take it for a ride. It did not\ndisappoint and was the most fun I've had driving the many cars in\nour inventory here in a while. An awesome kick is had with a press\nof the accelerator, plenty of straight bias free whoa on the solid\nbraking, and solid handling was exhibited. Unfortunately, our test\ntrack hasn't been upgraded with 4x4 accommodations just yet, so\nI'll save the off-roading for you. While Classic Auto Mall\nrepresents that these functions were working at the time of our\ntest drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at\nthe time of your purchase.\nPlenty of thoroughbred power, the sure footedness of a mountain\ngoat, and looks to attract attention like a Clydesdale, this fine\nexample of the Ford Bronco from 1972 is just a load of fun to drive\nand looks great while doing it.

        "Ford boasted its original Bronco was the first 4-wheel drive sports car, and this 1972 Gateway Custom exceeds expectations. The Hamel, Illinois, based Bronco specialists created the handcrafted 4-wheeler in a frame-off build, from the powder coated frame and Raptor-lined undercarriage to the color-matched removable hardtop. The body was stripped to bare metal at the Gateway \"Bronco Factory'' and refinished in Candy Apple Red paint. Steel impact bumpers with a front winch and rear swing-out spare tire carrier and rear-mounted combination jerry can/cargo carrier augment legendary 4x4 capability. Blackout trim, badges, wiper arms and door handles add distinction. LED headlights and a center lightbar turn darkness into daylight.\nThe Bronco is powered by a 5.0L V-8 engine with electronic fuel injection, aluminum cylinder heads and ceramic-coated stainless exhaust for maximum output and modern driveability. A Ford Racing air cleaner, finned valve covers and an aluminum radiator keep the engine looking and running cool. The small block sends power through a 4-speed automatic transmission, and a 2-speed transfer case distributes the twist to all four wheels through a Dana front differential and 9-inch rear end. More clearance comes by way of Bilstein 2-inch suspension lift. Front and rear sway bars and Wilwood 4-wheel disc brakes with Hydroboost deliver on- and off-road control.\nPower retractable side steps offer an invite to the air-conditioned cabin. Porsche leather seats with suede inserts and red stitching over wool carpet deliver premium sports touring luxury, and three-point seat belts and a family roll bar add modern safety. Power windows with vintage handles and a Classic Instruments all-electronic factory replica instrument cluster exude original '70's style. A concealed Alpine sound system, and Tuffy locking center console with embroidered armrest and cup holders bring modern entertainment and impervious security to the factory formula. The bespoke Bronco waits for its next owner to take the wood rimmed steering wheel and create new adventures on satin black finish slot mags and BF Goodrich All-Terrain KO2 tires.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nFrame-off build completed by Gateway Bronco in Hamel, Illinois\nBody stripped to bare metal\nPowdercoated frame, Raptor-lined undercarraige\n5.0L V-8 engine with aluminum heads\nElectronic fuel injection\nBilstein 2 inch aluminum body lift\nFront and rear sway bars\nWilwood 4-wheel disc brakes with Hydroboost\nCandy Apple Red finish\nPorsche high-back leather seats with suede\nAir conditioning\nPower retractable side steps",

        "1970 Ford Bronco three on the tree. Underwent a full restoration before I bought it in 2020. The motor is a 302-2V. Interior floor has a Rhino type coating. I bought it for my daughter who has given up on learning to drive a standard. Since I bought it, I have installed a new instrument cluster, hence the low mileage, a Classic Car stereo and speakers, and a hydraulic rear window lift (It cut down on the roof rattle tremendously). It\u2019s a fun car to drive for anyone who knows about first generation Broncos, just not my daughter.",

        "GORGEOUS, FULLY RESTORED, MIDNIGHT BLUE METALLIC 1971 U14 FORD BRONCO HALF CAB, 302 V8, AUTOMATIC, POWER STEERING, POWER BRAKES, AIR CONDITIONING, READY TO SHOW AND GO!!\n!\nThis is an absolutely beautiful 1971 Ford Bronco U14 Half Cab that received a beautiful restoration from a gentleman in Oregon who I have purchased several early Bronco Classics from over the years. He and his wife are true Bronco and Ford truck enthusiasts and he has been restoring them for many years He purchased this particular one in 1997 out of Dewey, Arizona where it lived a rust free life and was originally a forest service rig. He built this one for his wife to drive so they could go to the car shows and events together and this was her baby.  Given that it was built for his wife, it had to be a reliable, nicely equipped, strong running, very comfortable rig that would turn heads everywhere. As you will see he knocked it out of the park and she loved this one and drove it for the past 26 years to the car shows and events or just out for a beautiful drive. The owners realized this Bronco was not being driven very much in the past few years and realized that it made sense to let it go to the next lucky owner, maybe you?!\nAs you will see this is an absolutely beautiful Bronco that runs and drives as good as it looks. I will include lots of photos, an honest description and a video so you can see and hear how great she sounds. I am also a transport broker so I can assist in getting you a great rate on transport anywhere in the US.\nPaint and body look outstanding. This was an Arizona Bronco before going to Oregon and it lived a very rust free life. Body panels are extremely straight body panel fit is excellent. Doors open and shut very well. Hard to believe the restoration was almost 25 years ago as the paint and body still look amazing. Paint was a custom PPG Base coat/clear coat Ford Midnight Blue with just a little violet added Original frame was super solid and was sand blasted and painted. This was a high end professional paint job and the Bronco was always stored in a climate controlled garage and shows fantastic. Bumpers were replaced. New emblems and front grille painted silver with new FORD red letters. Billet Headlight Bezels with Hella Halogen lights. Special 50th anniversary badge added to grille. High performance Azurelite glass keeps out 93% of the direct heat. Half Cab hard top is in great condition and a brand new bikini top was added for when the roof is off. The truck bed was double lined with Linex and looks great. Custom roll bar from Tom\u2019s Bronco and a high lift jack is mounted to the roll bar. I noticed just a couple of small chips that have been touched up.  Overall, the paint and body are definitely worthy of showing this Bronco off at local shows and events and will likely win its share of trophies if that is what you enjoy. It did win trophies for the previous owners.\nAs you will see in the pics it is a beautiful Bronco, sounds great and runs and drives beautifully.\nThe interior was nicely upgraded with a split bench seat from a 2000 Ford Ranger that was custom upholstered in more of an original Bronco pattern. Super comfortable high back seats and the fold down center console gives you a nice armrest or fold it up and put your kid between you like the good ol\u2019 days. This set up is way more comfortable than stock seats but still maintains an original color and pattern which looks great. Since it is an original half cab it does not have a rear seat but one could be added if desired. New door panels and new carpeting with nice set of Ford floor mats added. Nice sounding Kenwood stereo. Great Dakota digital gauge cluster that fits in stock location but provides much more info. Rich looking custom teak Grant steering wheel with a tilt steering column.  And for those of you living in the hot climates this baby has Ice cold Vintage Air Conditioning as well! As you will see, the interior is also show worthy and looks amazing.\nUnder the hood sits a completely rebuilt 302 V8 that was bored .030 over. It has a mild off-road cam , a Weiand Streetmaster Aluminum intake with Holley 650CFM Street avenger 4bbl carburetor with electric choke and Ford Kickdown. AFR Aluminum heads. Polished pulleys for power steering and air conditioning . High output Alternator and a Tom\u2019s Bronco big 4 core aluminum radiator to keep it running nice and cool. Power steering was upgraded with Burgeon 4:1 power steering box ( new in last 200 miles)set up with a new Saginaw pump. Power front disc brakes. Power is put to the ground through the completely rebuilt C-4 Automatic transmission that shifts great, with 3:50 gears in the 9\u2033 rear end so you can cruise at highway speeds with no issues. Dana 20 transfer case. Great stance with 2 1/2 \u201d Suspension lift. Sitting on a beautiful set of custom 17\u2033 wheels from 4wheel parts. They are 17\u2033x9\u2033wrapped in great set of 305/65/17 All Terrain Pro Comp tires. It sounds as good as it looks thanks to the 2 1/4\u2033 aluminized dual exhaust with a great sounding set of flow masters. Make sure you listen to it running in the video whihc is the 2nd picture you can click on the arrow to play the video\nThe underside of the Bronco looks great too. Floorpans are rock solid and everything is neat and tidy. Both fuel tanks in place and functioning. This Bronco has been updated as needed and has been a super reliable, well loved Classic Bronco! There has only been a little under 2700 miles on the build since it was completed so the drivetrain is very fresh and strong!!!\nDon\u2019t miss out on this quality build!!!\nAskingprice is $79,500 and serious buyers can call me at  with any questions.",

        "1975 Ford Bronco Ranger\nThe sport utility vehicle, abbreviated SUV, was a class of vehicle\nthat combined features from your typical road passenger car with\nelements from off-road vehicles. Ford's first entry into this arena\nwas with the Bronco. These cars were developed between 1966 and\n1996. They have become very desirable as time has gone on, so much\nso that Ford brought the Bronco back into production in 2021. This\nreimagining of the Bronco has done nothing but help the\ndesirability for the classic versions even more. This 1975 belongs\nto the first generation and was based on an idea from the Ford\nproduct manager that also conceived the Mustang. The goal was to\ncreate a competitor for the Jeep CJ-5, International Scouts, and\nToyota Land Cruisers. It is in very nice condition and drives\ngreat. It was originally a Yellow/Gold color but has since been\nrepainted in a dark Blue with the White removable hard top. All of\nthe glass is in good condition throughout with no issues. The\noriginal style bumpers are in place as is the stock style trim\nwhich all has a nice shine. Aftermarket chrome side steps have been\nadded which both look good and are also functional to help you gain\naccess to the cab. It also has custom wheels with locking front\nhubs and Goodyear Wrangler Authority All Terrain tires that were\nreplaced in 2020 (front) and 2021 (rear.) A spare with Bronco cover\nis mounted to the rear.\nTurning those tires is the largest motor available for this\ngeneration the 302 cubic inch 4.9L small block V8. It runs well and\nis fitted with chrome valve covers, a chrome air cleaner, and 4\nbarrel Holley carburetor. Backing that up is a 3 speed automatic\nthat shifts well. Disc brakes are in place up front and are power\nassisted along with power steering which makes it a very\ncomfortable driver.\nInside the Bronco are Gray high back bucket seats up front and a\nbench in rear. Being that these were built to be rugged off road\nperformers a majority of the steel body panels are painted and it\nalso has the roll bar in place. The door panels are custom made out\nof diamond plate steel and it has manual window cranks. Between the\nfront seats is the stock style steel center console and on the\nfloor is the 4WD controls. The dash is painted Blue with a Black\ndash pad and is where you will find all of the stock style gauges,\nknobs, and switches.\nThese Broncos are very collectable and have become very popular in\nrecent years.

All three\nwould come factory equipped with 4 Wheel-Drive, a 3 speed manual\ntransmission, and a 170 cubic inch 6 cylinder engine putting down a\nwhopping 105Hp.\nHowever, before Ford was sure the Bronco would be a huge success in\nthe off-roading realm, they decided to give one to Bill Stroppe and\nhis team, giving them permission to go pedal to the metal in\nvarious competitions. Stroppe took it to the 1967 Riverside\nFour-Wheel Drive Grand Prix and took home a Podium finish. In 1968,\nthey took victories in Rverside, Mint 400, and the Baja 1000. News\ngot around so quickly that Indianapolis 500 winner Parnelli Jones\ntook notice of them and joined the team. Jones ended up driving\nwith Stroppe and took victories in both the 1971 and 1972 Mexican\n1000 Race.\nDue to the Bronco's huge success, Ford decided to go all out on\ntheir last facelift of their first generation Bronco. On top of the\nalready existing 200CID Inline six-cylinder engine, Ford gave their\npride and joy, the '74 Bronco, a newly designed, 302 CID V8 that\nput down 125hp and 243tq. Just to mess and compete with Chevrolet\nand their blazer, they thought of an intriguing idea of sticking in\na brand new (to the Bronco, already equipped in the mustang at this\ntime) C4 3 speed automatic transmission, which actually ended up\nbecoming more popular than the pre-existing, 3 speed manual\ntransmission. The rear axle for the '74 was also upgraded to a Dana\n44, paired with the already pre-existing Dana 30 front axle and the\n9\" rear end, only drastically improved the off-roading\ncapabilities.\nThe 1974 Ford Bronco is the most sought-after off-roading collector\nSUV by enthusiasts mainly due to the available options and trim\npackages offered, the exclusive-to-1974 302CID V8 powerplant in the\nfirst generation, the automatic transmission, and ultimately, it\nmarks the end of the first generation Bronco that rolled off of\nFord's assembly line.\nThis particular Bronco was restored during its previous ownership\nbetween 2013-2023 and had been fitted with extensive desirable\noptions. On the outside, the truck was repainted in Midnight Blue\nMetallic with a white removable top. The front bumper, grille,\nmoldings, rubber seals, and windshield were replaced in the same\nyear. In regards to safety, a roll bar had been added to the mix\nand in terms of utility usage, a trailer hitch, a swing-away rear\ntire carrier, and dual side mirrors were added. The truck currently\nsits on a suspension lift kit which is supported by 15\" steel\nwheels, fitted with Firestone Destination tires.\nThe transmission was reportedly resealed and the transmission\nmounts, fuel lines, auxiliary fuel tank, and battery were replaced\nin 2019. The oil pan gasket and crankshaft seal were replaced in\n2023. The engine was reported at 137 horsepower and 222 lb-ft of\ntorque, and power is routed to the rear or all four wheels through\nthe C4 three-speed manual transmission and a dual range transfer\ncase. A 7.5-gallon auxiliary fuel tank was fitted from the factory\nas well.\nUpon arrival at Canepa, every collector car for sale is put through\nan extensive and diligent process called the \"Canepa Difference.\"\nThis includes a major and comprehensive mechanical inspection where\nall systems are checked, serviced, and restored as needed. They\nalso receive award-winning Concours-level detailing, including a\nthorough cleaning of each and every surface.",

No rust holes, small minor dents and dings. Roughly $3,000 new parts in box to include a new electronic fuel injection kit.\nI do have a title for the vehicle.\nReason for selling is simply the difficulty I am having finding reliable, timely, honest people to bring this to completion.

        "Introduced as a competitor to Jeep's legendary CJ and the venerable\nInternational Scout, Ford's awesome Bronco has always been a\nparamount of utility and versatility. And today, especially with\nthe reintroduction of the brand as a Ford Icon, its quickly\nbecoming a paramount of style and collectability. As with most\nthings in the collector car realm, the older the Bronco the better.\nAnd this documented beast, a timeless take on timeless Americana,\nfeatures a custom top, a world class restoration and a rich history\nthat makes it the only U13 Roadster of its kind! Looking for an\nexclusive classic that's built, buff and ready to rock and roll?\nHere it is!\nTHE ONE AND ONLY\nTough, simplistic and marketed directly to America's youth, Ford's\nU13 Bronco Roadster was, in many ways, a tall factory dune buggy.\nBecause these utes were used more as tools than cruisers, they saw\nfairly limited production; and the units that did roll off the\nassembly line often led brutal lives with predictably low survival\nrates. That's precisely where future collectability comes in, and\nwhen it comes to collectability, it simply doesn't get much better\nthan this Springtime Yellow stomper!\nOne of just 698 U13s produced for the 1967 model year, this truck\nwas also one of only 333 units marked for export, and one of just\n70 units exported to South America. But wait, there's more. In\naddition to being fitted with a unique hardtop and exclusive Barn\nDoors during its time in Colombia, it is presently the ONLY fully\nrestored U13 Roadster export that's made its way back to America.\nThat means it's also the ONLY fully restored American U13 that's\nequipped with Barn Doors.\nAfter almost four decades in Colombia, this fine Ford was brought\nback to its homeland and subjected to a frame-off, nut-and-bolt\nrestoration that was completed over the course of one year. That\nsaid, one year is probably a bit of an understatement since the\nproject actually started eight years ago when the restorer inked\npapers to ship the truck north. Naturally, an obsession with\nfactory-correct details exempted the retrofitted hardtop and rear\ndoors. And today, decked in correct Springtime Yellow two-stage,\nthis Bronco rolls as a literal testament to the glory of '60s\nDetroit steel!\nIn addition to some brilliant red stripes, this Ford was restored\nwith an interesting array of notable aesthetics. At the front of\nthe truck, an original grille hangs crisp parking lamps and old\nschool FoMoCo headlights above a chromed bumper. Behind that\ngrille, an original hood, complete with optional windshield\nwashers, flows to a hinged windscreen that's cleared by polished\nwipers. Original fenders hang simple \"Bronco\" scripts in front of\ncorrect Cab Doors that are built with polished handles and polished\nmirrors. Original quarters support a super cool Colombia-sourced\nhardtop, which is finished in white to match the truck's classy\ngrille and tough wheels. And at the back of that cap, a second\nchrome bumper guards factory taillights and distinctive, \"FORD\"\nbranded Barn Doors.\nCORRECT AND ONLY\nAs most Ford historians probably know, Dearborn kicked off Bronco\nproduction with a 170 cubic inch inline 6-cylinder. That means the\ncompletely rebuilt and carefully detailed mill you see in this\nute's super clean engine bay is factory-correct. Designed from the\nground up to be a tough-as-nails workhorse and, serving as primary\nBronco power for almost a decade, the Thriftpower Six is a favorite\namong vintage truck fans because of its simple design, adequate\npower and excellent durability. And, in the name of authenticity,\npretty much everything on this ute's 170 has been returned to\nintentional, factory-spec simplicity; with details like a correct\nFoMoCo washer bag and fresh Radio Resistance plug wires\ncomplementing items like a familiar Sta-Ful battery topper and\npliable FoMoCo hoses.\nONLY AS IT WERE\nRecruited directly from the factory to be a purposeful runabout,\nthis Roadster's been Built Ford Tough literally from day one! Power\nmeets the pavement through a correct row-it-yourself 3-speed, which\nwas the only kit Ford offered during the Bronco's early years. A\ncorrect 9-inch rear axle spins correct 4.57 gears that, fitted\nduring the truck's assembly, were a direct response to Colombia's\nlow compression fuel. A requisite Dana 30 front axle leads to a\n2.5-inch suspension lift. Stops are provided by a quartet of manual\ndrums. An aluminized, single-pipe exhaust system runs the entire\nlength of the floor. And everything rolls on heavy-duty steelies,\nwhich twist 30x9.50R15 BF Goodrich Mud Terrain T/As around\npredictable Ford lockers.\nONLY AS IT SHOULD BE\nBetween the doors, an original bench seat wears the same SMS vinyl\nthat Ford used in production. Opposite that correct Parchment\nsheen, a simple dash frames correct metric telemetry. Parchment\ndoor panels back factory handles and factory cranks. A retro\nsteering wheel spins above stylish T-shifter transfer case\ncontrols. And the exclusive Barn Doors reveal a fully painted cargo\nhold that's finished with a fifth steel wheel and spare tire.\nStoried, unique and lovingly restored, this fine Ford is an\nexcellent chance for any serious enthusiast to score a world class\ncollector car. One of the first utes that kicked off Ford's\nhallowed Bronco sub brand, it currently rolls as a highly correct\ntestament to why American trucks continue to make big gains in\npopularity and price.

        "Call for Details if interested please visit www.pmautos.com or call us Direct at \nThis is a stunning example of a 1970 Ford Bronco upgraded and slightly modified to the level at which it should have been originally built. This is an un-cut body and holds all the classic style and mystic we all like with a virtually stock appearance. The vehicle has a mild 2 1/2 inch lift and sits on 31 inch Goodyear tires, dual shocks up front and at the rear for a total of 8 much like the Bronco race trucks of the era, however this you may not be racing but suspension is dialed in, has a sway bar and stabilizer up front. Truck is very safe and comfortable to drive on the highway. Watch several videos of me linked in the ad to see it cruising at freeway speeds and a couple laps around the bay.\nThis vehicle is not only is Steller condition its built right and equipped with just about every option you\u2019ll need Power Steering, Power Disc Brakes, Power Windows, Siruis XM radio, tilt wheel you name it!! Air Conditioning is a nice and a somewhat difficult upgrade to have installed when running a 351 with small lift. Keeping the classic uncut look on these is the most highly desirable Broncos variation in this market. Some of the pro builders such as Icon, Velocity and Gateway all per-fect the Un-cut lifted and fully loaded LUBER (lifted un cut Bronco) but also command upwards of 85k to 225k for finished examples. This 1970 Bronco is not the Icon but as close as you\u2019ll get without dumping tons and tons of money. Finished in a stunning color its condition is stunning as well, this Bronco will make you Happy.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46tBOUfvDeA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOn9iRooamI\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E1sYKxU0vE"
