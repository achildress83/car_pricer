Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1968 Ford Mustang\n1968 Ford Mustang California Special Hardtop In mid February 1968, the California Ford dealers began to market a factory built, limited edition Mustang called the GT/CS, or California Special . It was born out of the need to spark interest in the model as the pony car craze began to blossom and when the Southern California sales manager saw the 1967 Shelby GT500 dubbed Little Red it sparked an idea for a special model that would appeal to Californians. The GT/CS was developed alongside the '68 Shelbys and in the end, 4,118 were produced. For consignment, a 1968 Ford Mustang California Special hardtop with a title verified 49,920 actual miles and a 289ci V8 under the hood. This one has the black vinyl top and some Shelby stylings that although did not spur the sales numbers Ford was looking for, it did create a special Mustang that is collectible today. Exterior Candy Apple Red paint is augmented with black California Special striping that travels the midline and terminates on the rear side scoops and also lines the back end of the rear spoiler. In front, Lucas fog lights live in the horseless blacked out grille while a pair of hood pins and Shelby style hood vents decorate the top surface. Both chrome bumpers are in great shape and the rest of the metalwork is nice as well. Our notchback has a black vinyl roof in good condition and a California Special script emblem on each rear quarter panel. Shelby style tail lights flank a pop off gas cap and reverse lights are round units on the rear valance. 15-inch Weld DragLite wheels now occupy the hubs and we note one of them is bent. Other imperfections include numerous scratches, chips, cracking body work, bubbling, some gap fitment issues, and a triple scratch in the black stripe. Interior Black vinyl door panels have a woodgrain strip inside the pleated patterned insert which shows a bit of waviness on the doors and some separation on the driver's side. Low back bucket seats have textured and pleated inserts, all in good condition, and the black vinyl continues on the back 2+2 seating where we find one window crank off its mount. A wood rimmed 3 spoke steering wheel shares the column with an AutoMeter tachometer in front of the wood applique lined dashboard and standard gauge package. An updated Mustang branded AM/FM/Cassette radio is in the center and warm woodgrain applique covers the dash in front of the passenger and above the glove box. A Hurst shifter is floor mounted with a rubber boot and surrounded by loop style carpet in good shape and a center console with armrest and cupholders has been added. An overhead console stretches to the back of the car adorned with more woodgrain applique and the headliner itself looks to be in very good condition. The trunk is clean and painted and houses a fuel cell. Drivetrain Under the hood is a 289ci V8 with a Holley 4-barrel carburetor and a T5 5-speed manual transmission sending power to the Ford 9 in back. Disc brakes are found on the rear wheels and drums in front. Headers begin the exhaust process in this clean engine bay which features a chrome shock tower brace, Monte Carlo bar and valve covers. Undercarriage Driver quality underneath with its fair share of surface rust in the usual areas. The dual exhaust enters FlowMaster mufflers after an H-pipe and then dumps under the car. The driveshaft runs through a loop on its way to the back while coil spring suspension is employed up front and a 4 link with coilovers are out back. There's one spot of invasive rust on the inside rear quarter panel. Drive-Ability We'll head west with this one and take the California Special on a test run. The 289 with headers and short exhaust creates a little earthquake of sound under the seats and the car rolls around the track like a mudslide, smoothly. We surf the gears and ride a wave of acceleration which is quite good and the brakes stop the car like rush hour on the 405. As far as functionality, the left rear turn signal doesn't blink, the reverse lights do not illuminate, and the fog lights don't work. Minor dysfunctions from something with California in the name. Everything else worked as intended. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. While not fully original, this is a real California Special and when was the last time you saw one? These are really quite rare and until tributes were produced by Ford in 2007 and subsequent years. We're thrilled to have one in our Hallowed Halls with low mileage and a Marti Report that comes with it. Take the 15 to the 40 and head east to the PA Turnpike, then get off at the Morgantown exit.

The convertible top needs replacing, the paint shows wear with chips in some spots, and thechrome could use attention. Despite these imperfections, it still looks fantastic from a few steps away and turns heads everywhere it goes. Pricing this car has been a challenge\u2014$34,000 is my best estimate based on comps, but I\u2019m open to reasonable offers. This car has brought me joy through family memories and the restoration process, but it\u2019s time for someone else to make their own memories. If you\u2019re looking for a classic Mustang that\u2019s ready to drive and enjoy, with room for finishing touches, this is the one.

Here's a breakdown of the 1967 Camaro RS's history Born from the Mustang's Success In 1964, Ford's Mustang became a runaway hit, and Chevrolet scrambled to create a competitor. The Camaro, built on the upcoming Chevy II Nova platform, arrived in showrooms by fall of 1966. The RS Package All About Appearance The RS wasn't a performance package like the SS (Super Sport). It focused on aesthetics, offering a sportier look for the base Camaro. The key feature of the 1967 Camaro RS was the hidden headlights. They retracted electrically behind motorized panels in the grille, creating a cleaner, more aerodynamic front end. Other RS additions included distinctive front grille inserts, special taillight lenses, and RS badges. Sharing the Spotlight The RS package could be combined with the SS package, creating an RS/SS Camaro. In this case, the RS badging took precedence visually. 1967 was the only year for the unique center console design and instrument cluster layout offered in the Camaro A Strong Debut, but Not the Sales Leader While the 1967 Camaro, including the RS, was a success, it couldn't dethrone the Mustang in sales that year. Chevy sold 220,906 Camaros compared to Ford's 472,121 Mustangs However, the Camaro, including the RS, did chip away at Mustang's dominance, paving the way for future sales victories.

From 1965 to 1966, a few subtle exterior items changed included the door scoops which were done with a 3 bar, black and chrome variant in 1966, the vertical bar through the running horse on the grille was gone in 1966 and the grille itself went from honeycomb design to vertical and horizontal bars, and back up lights were standard for 1966 and optional for 1965, so if you don't see them chances are it's a 1965. For consignment, a 1966 Ford Mustang convertible, driven just 500 miles since a total restoration was done to showroom specifications according to our consignor, and the restorer managed a body shop at a Ford dealership, so you know specs were checked. Photos of the restoration will accompany this car. Exterior This hue of sky blue is known as Acadian Blue and it's here in two stage form. The familiar face of this classic features the new grille for 1966 and the horse in the corral above a nicely chromed front fender with lower supports that waterfall down on a body colored lower fascia. The tell tale door scoops or faux quarter panel vents are affixed at the termination of the body crease detail and the tail end trails off with the smooth, short panels of the rear fenders. Looking at the back reveals an instantly recognizable tail which cannot be confused for any other classic. The triple tail lights, the center gas cap, the body colored valance, and another good showing of a chrome bumper means Mustang, pure and simple. Our wheels here are 14-inch with wire wheel covers and faux knockoffs wearing tires with an early 2021 production date. Up top we have a white canvas top with clear plastic window in great condition and with the top down, a medium blue tonneau cover finishes the appearance and is also in great condition. All chrome and metal work is in fantastic condition. Imperfections include some apparent panel gap alignment issues and some damaged paint in one of those gaps. Interior Vinyl clad door cards contrast dark blue and light blue, showing some discoloration on the lighter part, but the center inserts are in very good condition. Two tones are carried onto the seats where light blue surrounds tuck and roll inserts in darker blue, textured vinyl and none of the seats, including the back bench appear to have any damage or wear whatsoever. A blue 3 spoke steering wheel with horn buttons on each occupies the column which traces down to the elongated oval dash that houses five gauges including the large speedometer front and center. Over the top a dark blue dash cover is sculpted around the radio, in this case an AM/FM unit while a bank of four round vents is mounted under the dash in another oval design. Oval also dictates the shape of the glove box and from there, we note the Mustang T-shifter in the center console on a plastic and metal tray base that shows a touch of patina but is in fine shape. Blue loop carpet with vinyl inserts occupies the driver's footwell and the carpet continues throughout. A loose fitting but period correct plaid mat covers the sizable trunk. Drivetrain Show worthy clean and tidy, the engine bay holds a 200ci inline 6 cylinder engine with Ford blue painted parts and clean connections and hoses. A 1-barrel carburetor sits on top and a C4 3-speed automatic transmission is mounted behind and sends power to the Ford 7.25 rear with 3.20 conventional gears. The car is equipped with power disc brakes with slotted and drilled discs in the front and power drums in the rear. Undercarriage A lovely flat black covers the underside which is as clean as can be. If it was driven 500 miles since the restoration, you certainly can't tell from the underside. There's no surface rust, oil, or grease build up to report, so let's go over the major features. The clean single exhaust meets a stock style muffler then terminates before reaching the bumper and is not visible from the outside. Suspension consists of coil springs in the front and leaf springs in the rear. Drive-Ability Smooth surfaces on the inside are quintessentially 60's and it's all a bit slick compared to the materials used in modern cars, and that's a big part of the charm. She starts right up and we take a lap in this blue beauty where it performs wonderfully. This is clearly a cruiser, not a racer, and provides some wonderful open air fun with all functions working, save for the horn. With the top down, you'll be able to yell Let's go, buddy, the light is green! . While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. It's refreshing to see a 1966 Mustang with the 120 horsepower inline 6 still in the car! In many circles, the original configuration is more desired than a modified engine bay where the six is pulled to make room for an eight. This car represents a common spec with more than 70,000 convertibles produced, often with the inline 6 and automatic transmission.
