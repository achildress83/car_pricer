This 1965 Ford Bronco more than fills the bill. This project does start, run and drive around a parking lot. Note The brakes do not function. Made in Ford's Wayne Michigan assembly plant in August 1965, this compact sport-utility vehicle is dressed in white over Sahara Beige (code H). The paint and trim are in satisfactory order, while the car's bodywork is straight. The chrome bumpers fit tightly to the body but are in similar condition to the rest of the vehicle's exterior. The hinged windshield folds down. This is a very early production number of the first year bronco was offered. This Bronco rolls on a mix of radials, size 275/75R15 at all four corners. The truck has no wheel covers, just steel wheels with front locking hubs and Equa-lock axle. There is a full-sized spare tire in the back. The tires and wheels are all in poor condition. It rides on a 92-inch wheelbase and has a 3,900 GVWR. For 1966, three Bronco body configurations were offered, including a two-door wagon, a half-cab pickup and an open-body roadster. Under the hood is a 170 CID 12-valve straight six-cylinder engine backed by a floor-mounted three-speed manual transmission and a 3.20 1 rear end. To lower production costs, at its launch, the Bronco was offered solely with a three-speed, column-shifted manual transmission and floor-mounted transfer case shifter. To simplify production, all examples were sold with four-wheel drive; a shift-on the-fly Dana 20 transfer case and locking hubs were standard. The rear axle was a Ford nine-inch unit, with a Hotchkiss drive and leaf springs; the front axle was a Dana 30. The vin plate (detached) does match the vin stamping on right front frame member. Inside, the truck's front buckets are in poor shape, there's no carpeting and the headliner is in similar shape. There's an original two-spoke steering wheel framing the original dashboard. The original inner door liners, the dash and steering wheel are all worn out. A factory AM radio completes the interior. The idea behind the Bronco began with Ford product manager Donald N. Frey in the early 1960s (who also conceived the Ford Mustang) and was engineered by Paul G. Axelrad, with Lee Iacocca approving the final model for production in February 1964, after the first clay models were built in mid-1963. Developed as an off-road vehicle (ORV), the Bronco was intended as a competitor for the Jeep CJ-5, International Scout and Toyota Land Cruiser. Today a compact SUV in terms of size, Ford marketing shows a very early example of promoting a civilian off-roader as a Sports Utility (the two-door pickup version). Competition to this Ford in 1966 included Jeep's CJ-5, International's Scout 800 and Toyota's Land Cruiser. If you like restoring 4x4 vehicles and you've never had a first-generation Ford Bronco in your garage, this is your opportunity to restore one. Visit MotoeXotica Classic Cars today to check out the foundation this Bronco offers for you to either restore to showroom new or take it in a totally different direction. VIN U15FL733163 This truck is currently located at our facility in St. Louis, Missouri. Current mileage on the odometer shows 98,635 miles. It is sold as is, where is, on a clean and clear, mileage exempt title. GET OUT AND DRIVE!!!

Popularly known as \u201cK-code\u201d\u2014in reference to the special letter designation in the VIN of Mustangs so equipped \u2014 the package included a 289 cubic-inch V-8 engine rated at 271 horsepower and a medley of performance items for a whopping $442.60. Except for the $283.20 air conditioning, no other Mustang option had such an impact on buyer\u2019s wallets, which meant that K-code production was understandably low. The car\u2019s solid-lifter V8 was not the average Ford small-block. Inside its over-square, four-inch cylinder bores were high-strength flat-top aluminum pistons. These were linked via heavy-duty connecting rods with strengthened rod bolts to a more robust cast-iron crankshaft with an enhanced front counterweight to maintain high-rpm balance. Each cylinder head had enlarged intake and exhaust valves, while the engine breathed through cast-iron, header-type manifolds and into a standard dual exhaust system. A Special Handling Group helped make the most of all the power with heavy-duty shocks, springs, and a front sway bar. The superlative 1965 Ford Mustang 'K-Code' Convertible featured here is finished in stunning dark Ivy Green over a Black interior with a White power-folding convertible top. This exquisite Mustang convertible was delivered from the factory with the highly desirable K-code 271-hp \u201cHi-Po\u201d 289 cu. in.

This '68 Yenko Camaro tribute received a stunning frame off restoration. You don't see a 68 Yenko, it stands apart from the others. A new ZZ502 Crate engine elevates it to the next level. Additionally custom TMI buckets, custom gauges and a top quality paint job provide unprecedented style and comfort. Fresh with only 1,230 miles since completion. We acquired this from a fussy collector. I look forward to his phone call with something for sale! Any angle you look at her from, she is pretty and powerful and ready to hit the streets! EXTERIOR Exceptional body and paint work! The Cortez Silver paint has just the right amount of flake to make it shimmer and is laid out perfectly. It's seriously polished like a piece of glass, so smooth and slick. The black stripe is properly done to factory dimensions. Looking down the side of the arrow straight body is satisfying thanks to the smooth contours and crisp lines. The panels are very nicely aligned with gaps that are well above average. The spoilers and hood scoop really enhance the profile. Everything up front looks spotless, it even has correct T3 headlights. Yenko badges pay homage to the original. The windshield and rear window are new. The rubber seals and fuzzy strips were even replaced. The bumpers and remaining trim pieces all have a glorious shine. It's equipped with dual side mirrors and the door ledge moldings too. It has the ideal stance and is rolling on 15 Rally II Wheels which is what Yenko used in 1968.

Enjoy all that brute power knowing it has the ultimate in reliability. We have the paperwork on this engine, it was purchased new 11-23 and only 1,230 miles have been put on it. It comes with aluminum heads and intake and an HEI ignition. A new dual feed Holley carb and a set of coated Doug's headers were installed. It features a few upgrades including hydroboost power steering and a power brake system. It also has a new radiator and clutch fan. Upgraded DSE wiper system. A Delco battery topper and reproduction spring clamp cables add a nice vintage look. The underside of the fiberglass hood, fenderwells and firewall are all neatly painted satin black.

Inside is all rust free and solid metal with a coating of black paint and a new rubber mat. It also has a new tire and painted rim for a spare tire and the jack assembly. UNDERSIDE Very nice! The steering was rebuilt and works great. Springs and shocks were replaced up front plus it has a swaybar. The leaf springs out back also look fresh and have new hardware too. The brakes have been completely rebuilt and even the emergency brake is hooked up, they are disc upfront. Long tube headers and a stainless Flowmaster exhaust system have this monster sounding mean. The gas tank and all the lines were replaced. Looking up at the motor it has a Milodon extra capacity oil pan. The flywheel cover, trans pan and rear end cover are a matched set; a very cool looking finned aluminum painted black with polished find. The Turbo 400 automatic trans was serviced, a new torque converter was installed. It also has a 12 bolt rear end with new 3.42 posi gears. The floors are solid and rust free with neatly applied black paint. SERVICE Our shop manager thoroughly inspected this car and we replaced the center console, shifter and trim rings on the wheels. We also lubed the left rear window, adjusted the exhaust and balanced the wheels. This killer machine with a raging 502 V8 has got what it takes to be the boss! The looks are killer too.

Introduced as part of the Camaro's first generation, the Z/28 option was Chevrolet's response to the Trans-Am racing series. It was designed specifically for competition, with its high-revving 302 V8 engine, providing an ideal balance of power and handling to meet the series' 5.0-liter displacement limit. Coupled with a manual transmission, this Z/28 RS offers the raw driving experience that enthusiasts seek. The Rally Sport (RS) package brings distinctive cosmetic upgrades, including the signature hideaway headlights, unique grille, and chrome accents, which add an extra layer of style to the Z/28's aggressive performance-focused design. This particular example has been meticulously restored by Antique Auto Restorers, with just 10,000 miles driven since its full restoration. The total mileage on the car is 86,000 miles, indicating that it has been well-preserved over the decades. Dressed in Hugger Orange with black racing stripes, this Camaro's striking exterior is complemented by a beautifully maintained black leather interior.

A ram air 428 paired with a 4 speed manual plus upgraded steering and suspension makes it a blast to drive. Even when it's parked, this fastback with all the goodies and grabber yellow paint is exciting just to look at! EXTERIOR Scoops, spoilers, and stripes! The fastback is one of all time best looking designs; add to all the dress up features like rear window louvers and it is a knock out! Looking down the side of the body it is 100% laser straight with smooth contours and crisp lines. The panels are nicely aligned with consistent gaps that are above average. The doors close easily with minimal effort. The paint was applied with expert detail then polished to a smooth and slick finish. The glass looks good plus the rubber seals and fuzzy strips were replaced. The front grill, headlights and taillights look like new. The bumpers were rechromed and the remaining trim has a lustrous shine. I really like the reflective stripe going down the side of the body. It's sitting on a set of 15 Magnum 500 wheels wrapped in Cooper Radial G/T tires. INTERIOR It has a deluxe interior featuring high back bucket seats, molded door panels, wood grain trim and a console. Everything has been replaced or restored with remarkable finishes. Even the clock on the passenger side dash is working. It has a real wood steering wheel plus seatbelts front and back. The am/fm stereo appears to be original and in nice shape. The headliner, sun visors, and carpeting were also replaced. The Hurst 4 speed manual shifter is new and a blast to throw around. All the seats were refinished and feel amazing. A complete and proper deluxe interior! ENGINE COMPARTMENT That's a 428 stuffed in there! Power steering and brakes along with a modernized air conditioning system also fits under the hood. Well, the ram air didn't fit, which gives it that cool shaker scoop protruding through the hood. An aluminum radiator keeps it running cool. The battery is properly secured and the squirters are hooked up. The underside of the hood was painted slick just like the car. The fenderwells and firewall are neatly painted satin black. Every nut and bolt were replaced. What a stunning engine bay! TRUNK COMPARTMENT The underside of the trunk lid and jamb are painted just like the body. The latch assembly was replaced and has new hardware too. It has a new gas tank and filler neck as well. Under the trunk mat is all clean, solid and rust free metal with neatly applied Grabber Yellow paint. UNDERSIDE The front end was replaced with an upgraded system that includes rack & pinion steering, tubular control arms coilover adjustable gas shocks and a swaybar. Welded in frame rails connect the front to the back and prevent body twist. Out back the springs and shocks look fresh and a set of traction bars keeps the rubber on the pavement. Great sounding exhaust with Flowmaster mufflers and quad tips going through the valance. Disc brakes up front, and the e-brake assembly is hooked up. The fuel tank and sending unit were also replaced. Looking up at the motor it is clean and has an extra capacity oil pan. The top loader 4-speed is spotless, and the rear end looks fresh. The floors are clean metal painted black. SERVICE After we gave it our inspection we replaced the plugs and wires, rebuilt the Hurst linkage, serviced the a/c including a new compressor, installed a radio bracket and column cover, fixed the heater vacuum controls, calibrated the speedometer, and adjusted the brake light switch. We also installed a new real wood steering wheel, new tie rod, new driver's door weatherstrip, new axle seals, new window trim, new e-brake components, and new Magnum 500 wheels. This is the Mach 1 to have; with a nut and bolt restoration, killer colors, 4 speed manual and a 428 Cobra Jet. Time to turn some heads and snap some necks!

The 302 engine, also known as the Windsor V8, was a popular option for the Bronco in the 1970s due to its durability and versatility. With a displacement of 5.0 liters, this engine was capable of producing up to 140 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque, making it ideal for off-road adventures. This particular 302 V8 was recently re-manufactured by accurate engines and includes a 100k mile warranty, with the transmission carrying a 2 year warranty as well. The automatic transmission, meanwhile, provided a smooth and effortless driving experience, allowing drivers to focus on navigating difficult terrain without worrying about shifting gears. Additionally, the Bronco's four-wheel-drive system and short wheelbase made it highly maneuverable, making it a favorite among off-road enthusiasts. In terms of design, the 1976 Ford Bronco featured a classic boxy shape with sharp lines and a simple, no-nonsense aesthetic. The interior was equally rugged, with durable materials and straightforward controls that emphasized functionality over luxury.

This Camaro was born 55 years ago wearing Dusk Blue paint with an Ivory standard interior and a 6 cylinder engine - but it is certainly a much different (and far better) car today. This 1st gen comes to us today with a beautiful glossy bright blue paint job with painted white Z stripes. Up front, a cowl induction hood sits above the black eggcrate grille with a blue bowtie badge at its center. A mirror-finish bumper and a black chin spoiler complete the iconic front end look. High-quality brightwork abounds with window trim, wiper arms, drip rail molding, dual side mirrors, 350 fender badges, door handles, wheel lip molding, and the '69-only rear quarter ornamental louvers. Keeping with the chrome theme are a set of bright 5-spoke Ridler wheels wrapped in new Kenda Vezda UHP A/S tires that are a perfect combination with this Camaro's killer lowered stance. Around back you'll find a single-piece rear spoiler on the decklid, another gleaming bumper, and another blue bowtie centered between the tail lights. To top it all off, all of the window glass on this car is brand new and flawless. It is impossible not to stop and stare at this car as you walk by! Your level of excitement is sure to tick up even a couple more notches when you lift the cowl hood and expose the impressively clean and organized black engine bay! This Chevy is powered by an orange 350ci V8 that's topped with cast heads, finned aluminum valve covers with cross-flags logos, an Edelbrock Performance RPM aluminum intake, an Edelbrock AVS2 650cfm 4-barrel carburetor, and a chrome Edelbrock air cleaner. At the front of the block are an aluminum water pump, aluminum pulleys and brackets, a power steering unit, and a Champion aluminum radiator with a large electric fan to keep things cool no matter the conditions. A new-looking master cylinder, booster, and proportioning valve provide power to the front disc and rear drum brakes. Exhaust flows through cerakoted headers, newer pipes, and newer mufflers before exiting the rear with an authoratative rumble that's sure to please. The V-8 is mated up to a 4-speed Muncie manual transmission that puts down the power via a 10-bolt GM rear axle with 3.23 1 positraction gears. This drivetrain combination is perfect for everything from doing a burn-out to taking a leisurely country drive to cruising down the freeway in the fast lane! Open the drivers door to find an exceptionally nice black interior illuminated by a working dome light. Both door cards appear OEM-correct and are in excellent condition. The front seats are beautiful black vinyl buckets with black white Houndstooth cloth insets, and there are just as comfortable as they are attractive. In the rear is a bench seat dressed in the same theme and of the same quality. Between the front seats is a center console that features a small storage box, seatbelt holders, a Hurst Shifter with a white pattern ball, and some great-looking woodgrain trim. The black dash sports a crack-free vinyl top and an original-looking instrument panel. The gauge cluster is simply a speedometer and a fuel gauge with warning lights for essential systems, but under the dash is a trio of Equus gauges to keep tabs on your temp, oil pressure and battery. Also included in the dash are a Retrosound-style AM/FM stereo, controls for the heater and fan, and a switch for the working 2-speed wipers. There is an aftermarket red switch on the left that is inoperative and controls nothing. Directly ahead of the driver is a 3-spoke Chevy steering wheel with a working horn at the center. Ahead of the front passenger is an empty but functional glovebox with an ashtray to it's left in the center of the dash. Underfoot is newer high-quality black carpet and overhead is a tight black vinyl headliner. Around back in the trunk you'll find a vinyl liner mat and two black rubber Chevy floormats. If you're looking for a 1st gen Camaro, a 69 Camaro, or just a seriously cool 60's muscle car - you're going to want to check out this amazing ride! It's got beautiful paint, gleaming brightwork, a killer stance, a powerful and versatile drivetrain, a 4-speed manual, upgraded brakes, power steering, and a Houndstooth interior with center console - what an awesome car!

The Central Office Production Order was a no-frills Camaro special ordered with the 427 motor. Typically, a 396 was the biggest engine they offered. EXTERIOR Just like the original COPO it's a base model with no fancy trim or stripes. Although they did use a functional cowl induction hood feeding fresh air to the 427 and spoilers. This one is a radio delete car, so it does not even have an antenna. This body is straight with no damage or rust showing. According to the cowl tag it is a code 72 Hugger Orange car without a vinyl top. It's repainted very smooth and glossy. The weatherstrips, chrome, emblems, taillights, windshield were all replaced. It is sitting on correct painted rims with poverty hubcaps, and they are wearing reproduction Wide Tread GT Goodyear tires. INTERIOR This is a no-frills interior too, restored to factory condition. In front of me is a 14 mph speedometer which is showing 600 mi since the restoration. It also has a factory tachometer and the rare center located fuel gauge. It looks like the dash pad, instrument panel, steering wheel, radio delete plate and heater control panel were all replaced. Down on the floor it does have new carpet, a Hurst shifter sticking out of the hump and a complete set of reproduction seat belts. The seat upholstery, door panels, armrests window cranks and handles were all replaced. ENGINE COMPARTMENT It has a correct 1969 427-425 horsepower motor sitting under the hood. The casting code and date make it correct and it also has solid lifters, rectangular port heads, factory aluminum intake and a dual feed Holley carb. The fuel line, distributor, exhaust manifolds, chrome valve covers look stock. Up on top is the functioning cowl induction system. It has reproduction hose clamps, fan shroud and correct curve neck radiator. It has power brakes with a cadmium plated booster. New wiring harness and alternator. All the surfaces are painted very nicely, it has hood insulation and PBT stamps on the firewall. TRUNK COMPARTMENT Under the trunk lid and the jamb are painted glossy. Inside is clean metal with a spatter finish paint. The orange painted rim has a never used tire with a reproduction jack assembly. It includes a car cover too. UNDERSIDE Body off frame restoration; the underneath is detailed and rebuilt like new. All the steering, front and rear suspension was rebuilt. The brake system was completely rebuilt, disc in front and drums in back. The lines, hoses, and e-brake assembly were replaced. The fuel system was replaced including the tank, sending unit and lines. The dual exhaust system still looks fresh. Looking up at the motor it's clean Chevy orange, has a factory type starter. Correct Muncie 4-speed transmission, the shift linkage was replaced. A rebuilt drive shaft leads back to a rebuilt 12 bolt rear end with 4.10 posi gears. The floors and metal is all smooth, not pitted and painted satin black. SERVICE Our shop performed their inspection and reset the timing and replaced the accelerator pump. They replaced the bellhousing, repositioned the transmission to eliminate a vibration, balanced the drive shaft and installed a u-joint strap kit. They replaced the tachometer, wired the turn signal switch correctly, tighten the visors, installed a lower steering column cover, replaced the blower switch and passenger door glass. They rebuilt the rear end with new 4.10 ring and pinion, axle bearings and seals, grease and posi additive. What a cool car! This is nostalgia.

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1970 Chevrolet Camaro\n1970 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 Hardtop 1970 saw the introduction of the all new Second Generation Camaro. The 1st generation Camaro, (1967-1969), was seen as a hasty response to the Ford Mustang. It was considered a compromise by some critics. There would be no compromises with this car. Due to production delays the 1970 Camaro was introduced in February 1970, halfway into the production year. Because of this, some people will call the 1970 Camaro a 1970 1/2, but officially the car is a 1970 model year Camaro. Good things come to those who wait, and this car was met with rave reviews from nearly everyone. Chevrolet had a winner that would run for 12 years. Thx tonastyz28.com For consignment, a 1970 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 hardtop with the Vee shaped grille and split bumpers, a desirable feature that came as part of the RS package on Z28's. It's got classic F-body lines, wide double stripes, and a later era 350ci V8 under the hood. Exterior Dark Blue Metallic doesn't look bad on too many cars and it looks great on this one, especially with the complementary white stripes that traverse over the raised hood, the decklid, and up and over the rear spoiler which leans back to shed the wind. The gaping egg crate grille has a metal surround while the round turn signals are an RS cue, looking great behind clear lenses. Holes for hood pins are in the hood which has a raised cowl flanked by dual sport mirrors. Out back, muscular quad tail lights sit below the spoiler while the chrome bumper contours around the license plate cove and a pair of exhaust tips split wide and finish up the symmetrical rear of the car. 15-inch Chevrolet SS wheels in charcoal look great and wear staggered size tires. The paint coverage is very nice, and we note a few imperfections including a ding on the top of the left front fender and some bubbling at the bottom corner of a door. Interior A plastic header tops the door panels which are constructed of stitch patterned black vinyl and the driver's side shows some separation of the insert while the passenger side is in good shape. Textured black vinyl covers the front bucket seats which are flat by today's sport standard but are in great shape and include a headrest. In the back, the same material is used for the 2+2 seating, and it looks showroom fresh, as do the molded plastic sidewalls. A 3 spoke steering wheel leads to a dash that is canted on the sides towards the center, creating a cockpit vibe and housing numerous gauges, knobs, and switches and a few holes exist where items are missing, and this includes the radio. A Hurst shifter is floor mounted, rubber booted, and surrounded by black loop carpet in good shape. The headliner has some looseness but is fully intact and the trunk is completely barren. Drivetrain Pop the hood and a show quality power plant greets you in the form of a rebuilt 350ci V8 from 1979, fueled by a 4-barrel sitting on top of an Edelbrock intake manifold. The valve covers and air filter cover are also Edelbrock products while bright red wires lead to the sparks and match the MSD ignition box on the firewall. A polished alternator and headers also add some eye candy to the engine bay. Backing it up is a rebuilt Muncie M20 4-speed manual transmission referring power to the 10 bolt axle out back with 2.56 gears. Power disc brakes live up front and power drums reside in the back. Underside The theme here is a little bit of everything amongst the otherwise clean underside. A little bit of surface rust. A little bit of oil on the pan and transmission. A little bit of road dirt but not much. Happily, there's not even a little bit of invasive rust. Meanwhile, the dual exhaust enters a pair of Flowmaster mufflers before exiting out back and suspension consists of coil springs up front and leaf springs with traction bars out back. Drive-Ability No complaints here as the V8 fires right up, sounds great, and moves this Z in fine fashion and with plenty of gusto. Handling is great, tracking is straight, and the brakes work as they should. Things that don't work include the horn, the heater blower, the wipers, the reverse lights, and the clock. All other functions work as expected. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. Here's a spicy little dish with all the right ingredients. F-body, Z28, split bumpers, racing stripes, a wing, a manual transmission, dual exhaust, and lovely dark blue paint.

Our lead mechanic said, this is the best driving Bronco he has ever driven; I would let my daughter drive it! It is also updated with air conditioning, a custom interior, and big beefy tires make this truck stand out from the others. The list just goes on and on. With the top on or top off there is so much fun to be had in this custom-built Bronco! EXTERIOR Great looking colors, stance, and wheels!

It gained this nickname because of the embossed ponies that were on the backs of the seats. The Pony Package is considered a desirable feature for collectors, and definitely adds value to first-gen Mustangs. Based on the Pony Interior\u2019s lasting popularity, it\u2019s surprising it was only offered for two years. Since then, enthusiasts have restomodded their first-gen Mustangs to also have Pony Interiors.

See pictures attached. The reason why the last years are so desirable is because they are the last to have the carbureted engines. After that they went to fuel injection and the teams would not sell you the systems for programming or tunning. That's their own research and development patents. Therorefe after those years you wouldn't be able to tune them. So the last of the carburated ones are the ones to have. All parts are available. Circle K in Mooresville NC has tons of parts just for Nascars, Atech Motorsports as well. Things like your clutch is Tilton Racing so you can order from Atech Motorsports etc.. Goodyear Tires you can get directly from SASCO. Fuel is leaded 110. I also attached a spec sheet of what fluid they require. Everything is there. I'm located in Miami, FL and can do a facetime or come in person. Most true race Nascars are rarely sold, and even more with their original engine. The engine is the Team patents, and they usually take them off. The engines are stamped Team Penske. & CO and are full blown Penske race engines.
