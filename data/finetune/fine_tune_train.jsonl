{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You estimate prices of items. Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1967 Chevrolet Camaro\n1967 Chevrolet Camaro RSHardtop Of the 220,906 Camaros produced in 1967, about 65,000 of them had the RS appearance package. You could also get the SS performance package mixed with the RS appearance package for a double punch, but stats on how many of the 34,411 SS model contained the package are unknown. Meanwhile, the covered headlights, revised tail lights, badging and other attributes make the RS a sought after Camaro derivative. For consignment, a 1967 RS that the owner dreamed about and was willing to purchase long distance, then tolerate mechanical issues, and finally fixing the mechanical problems with a new engine and electronic fuel injection to create a reliable, fast, and enjoyable RS. It's a real Z22 RS '67 in its correct color! Exterior Two stage Bolero Red envelopes this car which is enhanced by the black nose stripe surrounding the RS emblem on the fenders. The hidden headlights, this car's coup de grace, is an epic styling cue and the headlight doors retain the geometric pattern of the grille which creates a bit of a sinister face. The RS badge in lowercase letters is in the center of the black grille and we note some checking on the rim detail of the grille and headlights. A cowl hood adds to the meanness of the look, and a 327 badge on the fender, as we'll learn is not exactly what resides under the hood. The tail lights are solid red as the reverse lights are found on the lower valance for the RS variant. 15-inch rally wheels with slightly wider tires in back provide the roll. The paint, gaps, and metal work including bumpers are in overall nice condition, making this car fall squarely into the driver quality plus category. We note some touch up on a door edge and a slight dent to one wheel well trim piece. Interior The standard red door panels look great in red. Fantastic condition with a bit of warpage of the armrest/door pull but minor in its imperfection. The red vinyl buckets are of stock design and good condition as is the back bench with three sets of seatbelts. The RS center cap highlights the 3-spoke steering wheel, also in red, while dual gauge set in rounded coves let you know your speed up to 120 mph, fuel capacity, and other information indicated by idiot lights. The center stack has a vent, vent/heat controls, and an AM/FM radio housed in black panel. The center console is where we find the automatic gear shifter, a small T-shaped handle in a simple base with indicator. A small storage bin is just behind the shifter. The red loop style carpet covers the floor in fine condition, protected by Camaro branded floor mats. This red loop carpet was also used to cover the floor of the trunk and looks clean. The headliner is like a military bedsheet, tight and wrinkle free. Drivetrain After some ongoing battles with the 327, the consignor replaced it with a 350ci V8, added electronic fuel injection, and kept in place the Powerglide 2-speed automatic transmission. A 10-bolt rear is in the back and brakes slow this hot car down, discs in front and drums in the rear. The engine bay is spotless and show worthy with the block and valve covers painted orange and a chrome Edelbrock air filter element cover. Undercarriage Things are very clean underneath with the only surface rust noted is on the control arms up front. The dual exhaust comes off the manifolds where it meets a pair of Turbo mufflers, then up and over the rear axle to exit in downward facing tailpipes before the rear valance. Coil springs are found up front on the independent suspension while a mono leaf spring is found in the back. We note some residual oil on the oil pan, a drop on the flywheel cover, and a couple of drops on the transmission pan. Drive-Ability No battles here as the car started right up and the exhaust sang a wonderful tune! The very simple interior and good visibility makes these cars a joy to drive and the powerful 350 cubes is more than adequate. The car turns, stops, and accelerates like a champ and everything works. The beauty of crank windows, for example, is that they rarely fail! There's just something about the hidden headlights of an RS that makes it special. It changes the attitude of the car from a mild mannered pony car to a savvy cowboy with an ace up his sleeve and wearing his Stetson hat low over his eyes. In a dual on the street, the low hat and shaded intent wins every time.

This is an un-cut body and holds all the classic style and mystic we all like with a virtually stock appearance. The vehicle has a mild 2 1/2 inch lift and sits on 31 inch Goodyear tires, dual shocks up front and at the rear for a total of 8 much like the Bronco race trucks of the era, however this you may not be racing but suspension is dialed in, has a sway bar and stabilizer up front. Truck is very safe and comfortable to drive on the highway. Watch several videos of me linked in the ad to see it cruising at freeway speeds and a couple laps around the bay. This vehicle is not only is Steller condition its built right and equipped with just about every option you\u2019ll need Power Steering, Power Disc Brakes, Power Windows, Siruis XM radio, tilt wheel you name it!! Air Conditioning is a nice and a somewhat difficult upgrade to have installed when running a 351 with small lift. Keeping the classic uncut look on these is the most highly desirable Broncos variation in this market. Some of the pro builders such as Icon, Velocity and Gateway all per-fect the Un-cut lifted and fully loaded LUBER (lifted un cut Bronco) but also command upwards of 85k to 225k for finished examples. This 1970 Bronco is not the Icon but as close as you\u2019ll get without dumping tons and tons of money. Finished in a stunning color its condition is stunning as well, this Bronco will make you Happy. https //www.youtube.com/watch?v=46tBOUfvDeA https //www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOn9iRooamI https //www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E1sYKxU0vE Category 1970_ford_bronco"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Price is $62500.00"}]}

This vehicle was restored by the prior owner to a very high standard that would be close to concourse for it's merits. This is a solid, rust-free TN car that is Butternut Yellow over black vinyl bucket-seat interior with a black vinyl top. The options are Power Steering, Power Brakes, Tilt Wheel, AM radio (with Sirius XM radio in glovebox). EXTERIOR The body panel fitment on this car is exceptional, save for the driver's door which exhibits minor hinge-bushing wear allowing the heavy door to droop slightly. Otherwise, the body is straight, rust-free and exceptional otherwise. The factory Butternut yellow paint was repainted its original color about 7 years ago and still has it's brilliant deep finish with black stripes. All the chrome is in great shape with no missing parts. INTERIOR Black Vinyl seat interior appears to be original and is in near excellent condition. Carpets have pulled away from the door sill area slightly but otherwise has good color and n other wear. Interior is complete. Dash is intact. Dash pad is not split. The plastic dash gauge-face is starting to show some fade, but these have been reproduced and are not expensive. The owner preferred to keep this mostly original, save for the following subjective changes Current owner added Foose Wheels, the chrome air cleaner, chrome valve covers, and a Hurst Shifter. He had the presence of mind to save all the factory original parts for any purists except for the Rally Wheels. On that note, the Owner is willing to swap out the correct rally wheels to swap out the Foose wheels if this is important to the buyer. The vaccum-operated sliding headlight doors do not open. They can be manually adjusted, but are not currently working off the mechanism (doesn't affect lighting etc.), 2 or 3 small paint chips on the otherwise near perfect finish. 327-V8 has been rebuilt and is super quiet/strong. Car starts easily and runs well. Very quick! 4 speed manual trans is a joy to drive/shift with no issues. The black convertible vinyl top is in great shape and the plastic back window is not hazed over, but very nice. The top works easily up/down as it should.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You estimate prices of items. Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1969 Chevrolet Camaro\nLooking at the collector car market over the past several years, it's obvious that there are few safer places to park some cash than in a 1969 Camaro of any kind. But if it's muscle car royalty that you're after, it doesn't get much better than a car like this 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28. With a date code correct 302 DZ V8 mated to a Muncie 4-speed manual and wearing a diabolical Tuxedo Black-on-black color combination, this real-deal Z/28 looks is an absolute slam-dunk. These cars have been red hot for some time, and when an opportunity to grab one in great colors with a bulletproof pedigree comes up, well, isn't it time you owned your dream car? This beautifully restored Z/28 was comprehensively restored to NCRS standards back in the late-1990's and it's been so well-cared for and loved it's still an absolute stunner in person. Finished in Tuxedo Black and White stripes, a huge upgrade over the car's original Code 61 Burnished Brown, it's the epitome of what people imagine when they think about a 1st generation Z/28. After almost three decades, it's starting to show some of its age, with minor imperfections acquired through the years and signs of older prep-work becoming a bit more visible than when the car was fresh, but this car still presents very well despite some of those demerits. It's a higher-end, driver-quality ride that looks much younger than the build date would suggest, with a straight body, tight lines, and great gaps providing the background to the deep, shiny finish. Other than the color change, the restorers took no liberties, and everything is pretty much as it was when the car was delivered new, including the egg-crate grille, chin spoiler, bright bumpers with oversized optional bumper guards, and the traditional ducktail spoiler out back. The cowl induction hood is a steel piece that remains functional, feeding the high-winding 302 a steady diet of cool, clean air from the base of the windshield. The white stripes follow the Z/28 correct pattern, narrow at the front and wider at the rear so that they appear parallel when viewed from the front. All the chrome and stainless is polished up, and it wears correct badges in all the right places. The code 711 Black Vinyl bucket seat interior is anything but basic, and the black-on-black combination is really the best choice for a vintage Z/28 (let the letters from the Cortez Silver fans roll in). Period-perfect seat covers, including the federally-mandated headrests, were installed when the car was restored, but with such great care spent keeping the interior in top-shape, everything still looks and feels fresh inside. This car has several choice options, including a lovely woodgrained center console filled with white-faced auxiliary gauges at the mast, and the factory gauges just beyond that gorgeous Rosewood steering wheel feature a correct AC tach with a 6000 RPM redline. There have been no real deviations from stock in this high-point F-body, which means even the Delco AM/FM radio remains in the dash and a polished Hurst shifter manages the gears, while period-perfect pieces like the plush black carpets, taut headliner, matching door panels, and super-clean rear seat prove that that nothing was overlooked in this build. In back, the spacious trunk offers correct spatter-finish paint and includes a reproduction mat and a full-sized spare tire assembly with jack. The Z/28's legendary DZ-code 302 cubic inch V8 was created by stuffing a 283 crank inside a 327 block, and the over-square design means the Z loves to rev. Some of GM's best-flowing double hump heads were installed up top to feed the snarling small block, and a date correct Holley 4053 carburetor (rebuilt in 2019) makes sure it doesn't starve. Neatly detailed for show, the engine bay features Chevy Orange paint on the block, proper finned aluminum valve covers, and reproduction hoses and clamps throughout. Even the original exhaust manifolds were retained and left raw, so they look just like they would have moments after rolling off the transporter, and the black snorkeled air cleaner up top is the coupe de grace. All Z/28s were Muncie 4-speeds and this particular M20 hooks to a rugged 12-bolt out back with 3.73s inside, as well as a correct Gardner transverse dual exhaust system. The front end, all four springs, and master cylinder were rebuilt/replaced in the last handful of years, and even the engine was refreshed with a host maintenance items, meaning this Z/28 is ready for the road today. Shiny 15-inch Rally wheels wear proper Goodyear Wide Tread GT white-letter tires, finishing off the period-perfect presentation in a big way. Beautifully finished and an absolute blast to drive, this is a high-quality Z/28 that probably counts as an investment but remains ready to drive. Don't miss this chance, call today!

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1968 Chevrolet Camaro\nHIGHLIGHTS 383V8 hooked up to a 5-speed manual transmission! Detroit Speed goodies! Menacing black street machine! BODY OVERVIEW The body is clean and straight, showing that this car has been cared for since the restoration and modifications took place. Professionally wrapped in matte black film, any imperfections would become immediately obvious. The body lines are crisp and sharp, and this Camaro is bound to turn some heads! The carbon fiber trunk spoiler adds to that classic muscle car look, while contributing to this Camaro's absolutely menacing demeanor. The carbon fiber mirrors and front splitter are the finishing touches that not only bring the look of this car together, but also act as a subtle touch to let passerby know that this is no $40,000 car. PAINT CONDITION OVERVIEW This Camaro was professionally wrapped matte black, and it looks really, REALLY good. Getting a good wrap done can be a challenge, and matte black especially has a higher potential to turn out poorly. The wrap was well done, and is in great condition. The door handles, locks, and brightwork are all black now as well. With all modifications performed in the last few years, it's no surprise what good condition everything is in! INTERIOR CONDITION OVERVIEW Step inside the Camaro, and suddenly it feels as if it is 1968 again-for a moment. The tasteful aftermarket steering wheel leads your eyes to the Phantom gauge overlays. A glance to the floor will show a shifter for the 5-speed manual transmission. The interior is in nice condition, with original style black vinyl and cloth houndstooth seat material. The modern radio in the dash works at should, and powers an impressive but not overpowering sound system ideal for miles of comfortable cruising. MECHANICAL OVERVIEW Under the hood sits a 383 V8 pushing just under 343hp to the rear wheels. When accounting for drivetrain loss, one can assume that the engine is somewhere in the 400hp-450hp range. The mechanics of this car are truly the bite to its bark! The exhaust is sure to perk up some ears when cruising around town, and the performance of this car certainly backs up that slick, menacing exterior look. You won't believe how well this car handles! Outfitted with a variety of high-quality Detroit Speed suspension components, this Camaro is smooth, tight, and goes where you point it. WHAT YOU'LL LOVE ABOUT THIS CAR This Camaro has a subtle but unique look. The quality cosmetic upgrades and the myriad of tasteful mechanical upgrades make this Camaro the ultimate cruiser!

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1966 Ford Mustang\n1966 Ford Mustang Fastback 1966 proved to be one of the most successful years for the Ford Mustang, accounting for over 20% of the first generation Mustang production. 607,568 Ford Mustangs rolled off Ford assembly lines for the 1966 model year to satisfy strong demand for the original Ponycar. Of these, only 27,809 were fastback editions. This body style has become the most sought after collectible in today's marketplace. It was on the fastback platform that Shelby created the legendary GT-350 Mustangs. Their street performance, competition & market success bolstered the Mustangs stature in period and this model preference has only increased as the collector mustang Market has blossomed. Born on September 20th, 1965, this Mustang has undergone an extensive restoration bringing it back to a new found glory with a little extra muscle versus how it left the Dearborn assembly plant. Retaining its original exterior color of Silver Frost and two-tone black and ivory appointments on the interior, the restoration stuck to exactly the way this stunning and wildly popular fastback rolled off the Dearborn assembly line with the exception of some add ons that will be covered below. Buckle up, grab your lasso and don your spurs, we're going to tame this wild pony! Exterior This car has it all with the fastback styling, vented B pillar, new for 1966 stainless steel rocker molding, hockey stick door and rear quarter coves, and 17-inch Shelby style wheels on all 4 corners. All this steel is draped in Silver Frost, and it is looking very good save for a few inclusions, some sanding scratches and areas of wavy body filler. All chrome on the bumpers is good, and covering theengine bay is a split scooped fiberglass hood. A look from the rear reveals the iconic triple vertical cluster of taillights, GT badged fuel filler cap, an added ducktail style spoiler extending onto the rear fenders, and a large curved rear greenhouse glass. The front of the car features the horizontally barred billet style grille fronting sandwiched between single round headlights. Interior A few liberties were taken on the interior during the restoration and we note a change from the warranty tag's 22 code interior indicating standard blue vinyl. Very clean looking buckets upfront, and a 2 plus 2 rear bench with smooth black bolsters and nice ivory horizontal tuck and roll inserts. This is the Pony interior, so we see the stitched galloping horses on the seat uppers. As an added bonus the rear seat folds flat for a little more cargo space. Riding the hump is a long armed chrome Hurst shifter with the obligatory T-handle and it has great 60's styling. The new for '66 dash, within a black camera case, holds updated black faced and white numbered gauges with a center mounted circular speedo, round side gauges, and is flanked by a 3 spoke black plastic steering wheel. In the center is a digital AM/FM radio and heater slides, and on the passenger's side is a black texture finished glovebox. Black carpet floods the floors and is very clean as well as the ivory vinyl headliner. A shout to the original looking nicely finished correct plaid covered trunk and original looking spare. Drivetrain Under the scooped hood lies a circa 1978 302ci V8 topped with a 4-barrel carburetor perched atop an Edelbrock aluminum intake and has a Toploader 4-speed manual attached to the back go of it. All dressed up in correct Ford blue along with some polished Ford racing valve covers and a chrome lidded air cleaner assembly. Things are looking good here but could use a quick detailing to bring things up to show level. Rounding out the drivetrain is a Ford 8 conventional rear axle weighing in with a 2.80 ratio. Undercarriage All extremely clean and virtually no road dirt and only slight surface rust on untreated components. Black undercoating is covering the floors which have had some replacement patches installed during the restoration. We can see independent coil spring front suspension working with a leaf spring rear arrangement and power disc brakes all around. A like new dual exhaust system fed by headers snakes its way rearward to glasspack mufflers before ending in turn down tips in front of the rear axle. Drive-Ability Like I was a kid all over again as my parents had a 1964-1/2 hardtop version, and I used to stand on the hump as we jetted down the road. Sitting in it brought back memories, and it performed great, handled the test track swimmingly with all functions operating as they should, and had some sweet acceleration! It earns its name but it's also fast forward. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase.Here's a classic car you can drive! Here we have a restored and highly sought after fastback version of the Ford Mustang. Stepped up a bit from the way it rolled off the assembly line and a great combination to boot. If you are in the market for a moderately priced classic, that starts right up, and runs smoothly, this is the car that should grace your garage. Leave the kids at home in front of the TV and enjoy the sound of kid silence, carve some corners and you have nothing but great conversation, and a smile on your face. 6F09C116129 6-1966 F-Dearborn, MI Assy Plant 09-Mustang Fastback C-289ci 2bbl 200hp V8 116129-Sequential Unit Number WARRANTY PLATE BODY 63A-Mustang Fastback, Standard Bucket Seats COLOR F-Silver Frost TRIM 22-Blue Standard Vinyl Buckets DATE 20J-September 20th DSO 41-Chicago AXLE 6-Ford 8 2.80 Conventional TRANS 6-C4 Automatic Classic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and collectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate controlled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8 acres!).

What you see or think you see on the big screen is not always reality! None of the Chargers used in the movie were ever actually powered by a blown Hemi engine, like they would like you to think. In reality, most, including this one, were powered by a Chevrolet 350 affixed with a fake blower. This particular Charger is screen used and was built for stunt purposes. It was also used for green screen shots where they would film the actors in front of the green screen, without the car actually moving. After the movie, the car was restored replacing any damaged parts with other screen used parts salvaged from another car. It was restored to high enough quality to actually be driven on the street. This car was acquired from a museum 8 years ago and has been in our collection all this years but is we are now looking to finish our new showroom and to fund it will let this iconic car go to a new Home. This is a car for the hard core FF lover, only few cars were made for the movie. Fully authenticated with movie production documentation and the actual builder of this cars for the Studios,John Wiser, who sadly passed in 2019 and we were fortunate to meet several times before he went to heaven. $199,900.00 1. or  text or WhatsApp +1.

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1969 Chevrolet Camaro\n1969 Chevrolet Camaro Hardtop In the United States, we have the ability to exercise our free will. And if that means modifying a car to our liking, so be it! And We The People have been doing that for quite some time with some of the earliest cultural transitions taking place in the hot rod era of the 50's. When Camaros came along, and survived, they became the canvases for expressions of artistic and performance interpretation by the hundreds. No, thousands! For consignment, a Camaro masterpiece. A '69 Camaro that was born in Norwood, Ohio and over the years received a makeover, heart transplant, new shoes, and many other goodies for show and go. It's a fantastic build and a striking car that's ready to save you from the time and money of restoring a barn find. This is turnkey goodness at its American best! Exterior There are not many color combinations as hot as black and red. And this red car features a matte black cowl hood with intersecting fender hash stripes on steroids! The grille is red, but the headlight bezels are black. The rear fascia picks up the matte black and is the ideal background for the Z/28 emblem and taillights. Take a close look at those smoked tail lights, the three sections are stacked and canted outward but face towards the rear, a bit of geometrical trickery that is often overlooked. With the use of 2 inch drop spindles, the car sits low over the 18-inch Ridler chrome 5-spoke wheels. The chrome bumpers and metal work around the car are in great shape. For flaws, we note some drips where an overzealous paint gun stayed too long, some rust on the lower pinch welds, a dent on one rocker panel and a scrape on one wheel arch. If you're not looking for these things, they're otherwise unobtrusive. Interior The black vinyl doors are lined with horizontal stitched lines in one inch rows. That pattern is mirrored in the front bucket seats and the rear bench. A Grant GT 3 spoke steering wheel is at the helm and is a vast ergonomic departure from the stock wheel. The square gauge pods now house round white faced gauges, backlit in blue and with digital readouts. An AM/FM/CD radio with USB and aux ports also adds blue light to the interior while four more gauges are perched on the center console canted towards the driver. A Hurst shifter takes its rightful place in the center in a carbon fiber trimmed base. Black loop carpet fills the foot wells where we also find some external speakers. The headliner is intact but could benefit from some freshening to tighten things up. Drivetrain A 383ci stroker V8 is under the cowled hood with an Edelbrock 1406 4-barrel carburetor sitting atop it. A Tremec T56 6-speed manual transmission rows the gears and sends power back to the 10-bolt rear with a 3.08 ratio. Power disc brakes are a definite upgrade and found at both ends. Hooker Super Comp headers get things started on the exhaust end of things. The car is also equipped with electric fans, an HEI distributor, and air conditioning. The engine bay is clean and show worthy with bright additions and flame engraved valve covers. Undercarriage Generally clean underneath but not on par with the top side of the car. There is surface rust in the usual places including the rear diff, suspension components, and the frame. Flaking rust is seen along the belly pan where it meets the rocker panels and there's a spot of invasive rust on a floor panel. Some residual oil on the oil pan and some oil on the rear diff coming from either the pinion seal or cover. The dual exhaust connects with an H pipe and continues twinning down the length of the car where they meet Flowmaster mufflers, then exit just beyond the rear fenders with only the very tips of the chrome tails showing. Independent suspension is in front with coil overs and leaf springs with traction bars are on the back. Our cnsignor also states air shocks are present. Drive-Ability Here we go, into the wild blue yonder, or in this case the wild black asphalt of our test loop. The car fires up with mucho gusto and like a hot tamale, rolls out onto the track. The seats are comfortable, the steering wheel provides confidence, and the Hurst shifter is the star of the show. We're able to monitor temperature and systems through a myriad of gauges, something not afforded to all Camaros in 1969. She runs strong, handles well, and stops on a dime. Oh, and sounds pretty darn good, too with the only flaw being reverse lights that don't illuminate. We can't wait to get this one back so we can put it on display for all to enjoy! Finished and well done Camaro projects with individual expressions and customizations don't usually last long at the mall. Someone took this canvas and painted a red rocket with black highlights, a strong engine, some modern conveniences, and a stance that is simply cool.

Designed by the man himself, Walt Disney, the Ford Rotunda was several blocks long and featured a few noteworthy Ford models but the primary focus was the multiple Mustangs in various body styles on display. Ford considered the first Mustang as a 1965 but due to its release date these early cars are now labeled by collectors as a 1964.5 to distinguish them from the later cars. They can be identified by the serial number range found in the VIN number. This extremely cool 1964 1/2 coupe is a very nicely built car that incorporates some original and customized features to make a very unique classic muscle car. The car was completely restored in 2021 and took around 2 years to complete. It has all new paint done in its original Poppy Red color with a a unique White center stripe and the GT style stripe down the sides. In that side stripe is custom MUSTANG lettering on the doors and the year on the front fenders. The chrome on the car is in great condition and it has its correct style new front/rear bumpers and also has the new trim for the faux rear brake scoop area. The exterior handles and mirrors were also all replaced. The exterior lights all work properly and all have been upgraded with more modern LEDs. The glass is in good condition throughout, has a slight tint and is framed in very nice stock style trim. The car has a great stance and rides on a set of very clean American Racing Torq Thrust wheels with custom red Mustang emblem center caps. The wheels and BF Goodrich Radial T/A (P225/60R15) tires are all new. 5F07F143473 5 - Year and includes 1964 F - Dearborn, Michigan 07 - Hardtop F - Optional 260ci V8 143473 - Range for 1964 F code is 100001-250000 The car is powered by its original 260 V8 motor that has been completely rebuilt. During the process it got a new carburetor, new chrome Ford Mustang valve covers, a new alternator (replacing generator), new Mustang air cleaner and was also mostly painted Blue. It has a ton of very nice modifications and under the hood it is fully show ready. It has the export brace set up with chrome shock tower mounts. Even the shocks tops are red for a real cohesive look and little details like using new red spark plug wires on the new distributor are a nice touch. The car has a great sound through the dual exhaust that is all brand new. Backing up the motor is an automatic C4 transmission that was rebuilt and shifts smoothly. From front to rear the car was fully gone through with all new brakes, a new chrome brake booster, new gas tank, new battery, new suspension bushings, etc. If it needed something, it got it, down to even small things like a new windshield wiper bag. The interior of the car looks great and is done in a very cool red with white combination. It has its original bucket seats that have been recovered and look great with a custom Mustang emblem embroidered on the back. This embroidery was also done on the center of the rear bench seat. A custom painted console is mounted between the front seats and fits with the look perfectly. The door panels are also a red/white combo and new with all new hardware. The carpet has been replaced with new and is done in red with black Mustang floor mats. The only thing that was left untouched was the original headliner as it was in good condition. The dash is very clean in all white with a matching dash pad, column and steering wheel. The AC system utilizes underdash mounted vents and blows cold. Other very cool features include the custom red/white lap belts and custom door sill plates. In the trunk it received all new black carpeting.

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1967 Ford Mustang\nI am the 3rd owner of this car that was originally sold by Smith Ford, Lordsburg New Mexico. It was built in San Jose CA and has been restored from ground up including taken back to bare metal and repainted in the original Silver Frost. The interior has been renewed to original spec. The engine is the original 200 ci straight six that came with the car new. It has been rebuilt to drive smoothly on today's roads and highways in that it has oversize valves with hardened seats to accommodate lead free gasoline. The carburetor has been updated to a Weber dual throat and has headers to breath properly through a 2.25 exhaust system. The distributor has been updated to a DUI electronic ignition and the plug wires are custom made from Magnecor. It has the original three (3) speed top loader transmission. Two years ago I had Classic Mustangs of Houston add power steering and Classic AutoAir air conditioning. From the outset the car looks mostly like it just came off the showroom and it is anideal cruiser. The car is for show....not go, if you know what I mean. This pony will turn heads and gets attention at car shows. The wheel trims are original with the car and inside the car the original AM radio is still there. Interior wise I have added 3 point seat belts and got rid of the dash pull parking brake for a hand brake between the seats. My son mounted the tachometer on a custom bracketthat he built on a 3D printer that looks like it was always there. All dash gauges have been rebuilt. I no longer drive it. Shesits in the driveway under cover and I'll wash it every now and then and take it along the Seawall to keep it running. It's time for someone else to enjoy it. The body is straight and essentially rust free, however, a little surface rust has popped up here and there but it's not deep. This is a greatcar to take to the next level if you're so inclined. A conversion to automatic would be a breeze and of course there are those who will fit a new Coyote V8 into it. I understand why as I have one in my F150. But in all honesty this is a great Sunday driver that you will need to park away from others when you take it shopping. Data plate info Body 65A, Color 4, Trim 2D, Date 24K, DSO 75, Axle 3, Trans 1.

Sporting a unique combination of Rally Sport front bumpers to go along with its strategically placed Super Sport badges, this F-body is one of a kind.

Just beyond that wheel sits a seven-pod gauge cluster, while an additional trio of auxiliary gauges is situated at the base of the console just beyond the staple-style gear selector. An aftermarket FM radio with an aux input uses front center and rear deck-mounted speakers to seamlessly blend a bit of modern tech without disrupting the retro vibes of this muscle Car. Under the aggressive cowl-induction hood, we find a 400 cubic-inch small-block V-8 topped with an Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor and matching Edelbrock intake manifold. A set of long tube headers feeds into a true dual exhaust, while a set of performance mufflers add a throaty growl that gives this muscle car the perfect tone to match its ferociously confident exterior.

Ford freaks and Mustang maniacs, your attention please! If you're searching for a classic Mustang unlike any other at the car show then listen up. The legendary Mach One Mustangs had a variety of engine options, however, for 1970 the 335hp 428ci Cobra Jet was the baddest on the block. And you may not know, but allegedly the 428s could take a Boss 429 in the stop light wars of the era. According to Ford savant and officially licensed verifier Kevin Marti (martiauto.com), this Wimbleton White pony is one of one. That's right say it with me, One of One. 1130 Mach Ones produced in 1970 featured the 428 CJ teamed with the bullet proof C6 automatic. Of those units only 125 were white - how many of those are on the road today? Drum roll please....according to Marti, this is the only 428CJ, automatic, white '70 Mach One with a special ordered AM radio. I know, but it's still cool to have the only Mach One ever made in this configuration. The documentation provided by the current owner also could indicate this car was built specifically for a Ford employee of the time. In the last few years, the current owner has installed new exhaust, sent the carburetor to Holley for a rebuild, and had the majority of the wiring replaced. Here's the bottom line folks, this is a special car. If you've been waiting for a unique Mustang to come up for sale then wait no further. This Cobra Jet is ready for launch.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You estimate prices of items. Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1968 Chevrolet Camaro\n1968 Chevrolet Camaro Hardtop In 1968, there were two subtle design cues that differentiated the 1968 from the 1967Camaro. First, the vent wing windows in the 1967 modelwere removed, and longer side windows took their place. Second, a rectangular side marker was added to the front fenders. In 1969, rear side fender vents were added. And that, my friends, is how to quickly tell the difference between first generation Camaros from the side.And we learned even more about the car when Camaro guru Jerry MacNeish was a guest on the Classic Auto Mall Show during season one, available on most podcast carriers. For consignment, a 1968 Chevrolet Camaro hardtop with unknown mileage but dressed in killer red with black stripes, resto-modded with a high performance V8 engine, and wearing taller shoes forged to look factory. Exterior Matador Red pops off the body like a fire engine and is augmented by wide, black painted stripes that run in tandem over the hood, decklid, and rear wing. A cowl hood bumps things up a notch and a custom billet grille takes the place of the cubed version. Marker lights have been moved to the front lower valance that tops a chin spoiler and this all presents a unique face to the '68. Beautifully polished 17-inch Chevrolet Rally wheels really create a great stance with deep dish holding 315 tires in back and low profiles all around. No front bumper, but the back one is in fine shape as is the metalwork and trim around the car. In fact, we could find no exterior imperfections. Interior The standard Camaro black vinyl door panels are super clean with window cranks at the ready. ProCar low back front bucket seats are in place and covered with charcoal cloth. The pattern is copied on the back bench where RJS racing harnesses are provided for the passengers and there's also a roll cage for added safety. A 3 spoke steering wheel leads to a custom gauge cluster with six AutoMeter white faced gauges in a painted black dashboard just beyond the polished and tilt steering column. In the center stack, a Kenwood AM/FM/CD with Bluetooth illuminates the cabin and Vintage Air controllers are just below. More glossy black faces the passenger from the dashboard and a B&M shifter rises confidently from the center hump. The low pile black carpet is in great shape and the headliner is clean and fully intact. Drivetrain Under the cowl hood, a spotless 350ci crate engine with aluminum heads, an Edelbrock intake manifold, electronic fuel injection, and headers. Backing it up is a TH400 3-speed automatic transmission sending power to a Ford 9 in back and providing the spark is an EZ EFI. Power disc brakes are supplied at all four wheels. Undercarriage Except for the occasional cobweb, it's nicely clean underneath. The dual exhaust runs from the header to an H-pipe and continues their journey to a pair of FlowMaster mufflers before dumping discreetly under the car in the back. Detroit Speed front arms and coil springs make up the suspension while Detroit Speed leaf springs live out back and the entire car has been dropped 2 . Drive-Ability We crank the crate to life and it lets the neighbors know it means business. The healthy bellow follows us onto the test loop where the car has obvious power underfoot, smooth straight tracking and excellent handling. Braking is on point and acceleration is just a foot tap away. We note the rear tail light and blinker is not working nor are the reverse lights. All other functions work as they should. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. Part grand tourer, part drag racer, all glorious! Hey kids, let's go for ice cream. Buckle your racing harnesses! . A fantastic looking, running, and feeling car with a comfortable interior and go anywhere engine. Chevrolet may not have been thinking about 17-inch wheels and aluminum heads for their daily driven Camaros back in the day, but it sure does enhance this classic car today. No pressure, but '68 Camaros consistently sell here at the mall, and well sorted examples like this don't last long. 124378N326969 1-Chevrolet 24-Camaro 37-2 Door Hardtop Sport Coupe 8-1968 N-Norwood, OH Assy Plant 326929-Sequential Unit Number TRIM TAG 10B-2nd Week October ST 68 12437-1968 Camaro 2 Door Hardtop Sport Coupe BDY NOR27112-Norwood Body # TR 712-Black Standard Vinyl Buckets PNT P2-Seafrost Green, Black Top Classic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and collectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate controlled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8 acres!).
