{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You estimate prices of items. Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1967 Chevrolet Camaro\n1967 Chevrolet Camaro RSHardtop Of the 220,906 Camaros produced in 1967, about 65,000 of them had the RS appearance package. You could also get the SS performance package mixed with the RS appearance package for a double punch, but stats on how many of the 34,411 SS model contained the package are unknown. Meanwhile, the covered headlights, revised tail lights, badging and other attributes make the RS a sought after Camaro derivative. For consignment, a 1967 RS that the owner dreamed about and was willing to purchase long distance, then tolerate mechanical issues, and finally fixing the mechanical problems with a new engine and electronic fuel injection to create a reliable, fast, and enjoyable RS. It's a real Z22 RS '67 in its correct color! Exterior Two stage Bolero Red envelopes this car which is enhanced by the black nose stripe surrounding the RS emblem on the fenders. The hidden headlights, this car's coup de grace, is an epic styling cue and the headlight doors retain the geometric pattern of the grille which creates a bit of a sinister face. The RS badge in lowercase letters is in the center of the black grille and we note some checking on the rim detail of the grille and headlights. A cowl hood adds to the meanness of the look, and a 327 badge on the fender, as we'll learn is not exactly what resides under the hood. The tail lights are solid red as the reverse lights are found on the lower valance for the RS variant. 15-inch rally wheels with slightly wider tires in back provide the roll. The paint, gaps, and metal work including bumpers are in overall nice condition, making this car fall squarely into the driver quality plus category. We note some touch up on a door edge and a slight dent to one wheel well trim piece. Interior The standard red door panels look great in red. Fantastic condition with a bit of warpage of the armrest/door pull but minor in its imperfection. The red vinyl buckets are of stock design and good condition as is the back bench with three sets of seatbelts. The RS center cap highlights the 3-spoke steering wheel, also in red, while dual gauge set in rounded coves let you know your speed up to 120 mph, fuel capacity, and other information indicated by idiot lights. The center stack has a vent, vent/heat controls, and an AM/FM radio housed in black panel. The center console is where we find the automatic gear shifter, a small T-shaped handle in a simple base with indicator. A small storage bin is just behind the shifter. The red loop style carpet covers the floor in fine condition, protected by Camaro branded floor mats. This red loop carpet was also used to cover the floor of the trunk and looks clean. The headliner is like a military bedsheet, tight and wrinkle free. Drivetrain After some ongoing battles with the 327, the consignor replaced it with a 350ci V8, added electronic fuel injection, and kept in place the Powerglide 2-speed automatic transmission. A 10-bolt rear is in the back and brakes slow this hot car down, discs in front and drums in the rear. The engine bay is spotless and show worthy with the block and valve covers painted orange and a chrome Edelbrock air filter element cover. Undercarriage Things are very clean underneath with the only surface rust noted is on the control arms up front. The dual exhaust comes off the manifolds where it meets a pair of Turbo mufflers, then up and over the rear axle to exit in downward facing tailpipes before the rear valance. Coil springs are found up front on the independent suspension while a mono leaf spring is found in the back. We note some residual oil on the oil pan, a drop on the flywheel cover, and a couple of drops on the transmission pan. Drive-Ability No battles here as the car started right up and the exhaust sang a wonderful tune! The very simple interior and good visibility makes these cars a joy to drive and the powerful 350 cubes is more than adequate. The car turns, stops, and accelerates like a champ and everything works. The beauty of crank windows, for example, is that they rarely fail! There's just something about the hidden headlights of an RS that makes it special. It changes the attitude of the car from a mild mannered pony car to a savvy cowboy with an ace up his sleeve and wearing his Stetson hat low over his eyes. In a dual on the street, the low hat and shaded intent wins every time.

This is an un-cut body and holds all the classic style and mystic we all like with a virtually stock appearance. The vehicle has a mild 2 1/2 inch lift and sits on 31 inch Goodyear tires, dual shocks up front and at the rear for a total of 8 much like the Bronco race trucks of the era, however this you may not be racing but suspension is dialed in, has a sway bar and stabilizer up front. Truck is very safe and comfortable to drive on the highway. Watch several videos of me linked in the ad to see it cruising at freeway speeds and a couple laps around the bay. This vehicle is not only is Steller condition its built right and equipped with just about every option you\u2019ll need Power Steering, Power Disc Brakes, Power Windows, Siruis XM radio, tilt wheel you name it!! Air Conditioning is a nice and a somewhat difficult upgrade to have installed when running a 351 with small lift. Keeping the classic uncut look on these is the most highly desirable Broncos variation in this market. Some of the pro builders such as Icon, Velocity and Gateway all per-fect the Un-cut lifted and fully loaded LUBER (lifted un cut Bronco) but also command upwards of 85k to 225k for finished examples. This 1970 Bronco is not the Icon but as close as you\u2019ll get without dumping tons and tons of money. Finished in a stunning color its condition is stunning as well, this Bronco will make you Happy. https //www.youtube.com/watch?v=46tBOUfvDeA https //www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOn9iRooamI https //www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E1sYKxU0vE Category 1970_ford_bronco"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Price is $62500.00"}]}

This vehicle was restored by the prior owner to a very high standard that would be close to concourse for it's merits. This is a solid, rust-free TN car that is Butternut Yellow over black vinyl bucket-seat interior with a black vinyl top. The options are Power Steering, Power Brakes, Tilt Wheel, AM radio (with Sirius XM radio in glovebox). EXTERIOR The body panel fitment on this car is exceptional, save for the driver's door which exhibits minor hinge-bushing wear allowing the heavy door to droop slightly. Otherwise, the body is straight, rust-free and exceptional otherwise. The factory Butternut yellow paint was repainted its original color about 7 years ago and still has it's brilliant deep finish with black stripes. All the chrome is in great shape with no missing parts. INTERIOR Black Vinyl seat interior appears to be original and is in near excellent condition. Carpets have pulled away from the door sill area slightly but otherwise has good color and n other wear. Interior is complete. Dash is intact. Dash pad is not split. The plastic dash gauge-face is starting to show some fade, but these have been reproduced and are not expensive. The owner preferred to keep this mostly original, save for the following subjective changes Current owner added Foose Wheels, the chrome air cleaner, chrome valve covers, and a Hurst Shifter. He had the presence of mind to save all the factory original parts for any purists except for the Rally Wheels. On that note, the Owner is willing to swap out the correct rally wheels to swap out the Foose wheels if this is important to the buyer. The vaccum-operated sliding headlight doors do not open. They can be manually adjusted, but are not currently working off the mechanism (doesn't affect lighting etc.), 2 or 3 small paint chips on the otherwise near perfect finish. 327-V8 has been rebuilt and is super quiet/strong. Car starts easily and runs well. Very quick! 4 speed manual trans is a joy to drive/shift with no issues. The black convertible vinyl top is in great shape and the plastic back window is not hazed over, but very nice. The top works easily up/down as it should.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You estimate prices of items. Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1969 Chevrolet Camaro\nLooking at the collector car market over the past several years, it's obvious that there are few safer places to park some cash than in a 1969 Camaro of any kind. But if it's muscle car royalty that you're after, it doesn't get much better than a car like this 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28. With a date code correct 302 DZ V8 mated to a Muncie 4-speed manual and wearing a diabolical Tuxedo Black-on-black color combination, this real-deal Z/28 looks is an absolute slam-dunk. These cars have been red hot for some time, and when an opportunity to grab one in great colors with a bulletproof pedigree comes up, well, isn't it time you owned your dream car? This beautifully restored Z/28 was comprehensively restored to NCRS standards back in the late-1990's and it's been so well-cared for and loved it's still an absolute stunner in person. Finished in Tuxedo Black and White stripes, a huge upgrade over the car's original Code 61 Burnished Brown, it's the epitome of what people imagine when they think about a 1st generation Z/28. After almost three decades, it's starting to show some of its age, with minor imperfections acquired through the years and signs of older prep-work becoming a bit more visible than when the car was fresh, but this car still presents very well despite some of those demerits. It's a higher-end, driver-quality ride that looks much younger than the build date would suggest, with a straight body, tight lines, and great gaps providing the background to the deep, shiny finish. Other than the color change, the restorers took no liberties, and everything is pretty much as it was when the car was delivered new, including the egg-crate grille, chin spoiler, bright bumpers with oversized optional bumper guards, and the traditional ducktail spoiler out back. The cowl induction hood is a steel piece that remains functional, feeding the high-winding 302 a steady diet of cool, clean air from the base of the windshield. The white stripes follow the Z/28 correct pattern, narrow at the front and wider at the rear so that they appear parallel when viewed from the front. All the chrome and stainless is polished up, and it wears correct badges in all the right places. The code 711 Black Vinyl bucket seat interior is anything but basic, and the black-on-black combination is really the best choice for a vintage Z/28 (let the letters from the Cortez Silver fans roll in). Period-perfect seat covers, including the federally-mandated headrests, were installed when the car was restored, but with such great care spent keeping the interior in top-shape, everything still looks and feels fresh inside. This car has several choice options, including a lovely woodgrained center console filled with white-faced auxiliary gauges at the mast, and the factory gauges just beyond that gorgeous Rosewood steering wheel feature a correct AC tach with a 6000 RPM redline. There have been no real deviations from stock in this high-point F-body, which means even the Delco AM/FM radio remains in the dash and a polished Hurst shifter manages the gears, while period-perfect pieces like the plush black carpets, taut headliner, matching door panels, and super-clean rear seat prove that that nothing was overlooked in this build. In back, the spacious trunk offers correct spatter-finish paint and includes a reproduction mat and a full-sized spare tire assembly with jack. The Z/28's legendary DZ-code 302 cubic inch V8 was created by stuffing a 283 crank inside a 327 block, and the over-square design means the Z loves to rev. Some of GM's best-flowing double hump heads were installed up top to feed the snarling small block, and a date correct Holley 4053 carburetor (rebuilt in 2019) makes sure it doesn't starve. Neatly detailed for show, the engine bay features Chevy Orange paint on the block, proper finned aluminum valve covers, and reproduction hoses and clamps throughout. Even the original exhaust manifolds were retained and left raw, so they look just like they would have moments after rolling off the transporter, and the black snorkeled air cleaner up top is the coupe de grace. All Z/28s were Muncie 4-speeds and this particular M20 hooks to a rugged 12-bolt out back with 3.73s inside, as well as a correct Gardner transverse dual exhaust system. The front end, all four springs, and master cylinder were rebuilt/replaced in the last handful of years, and even the engine was refreshed with a host maintenance items, meaning this Z/28 is ready for the road today. Shiny 15-inch Rally wheels wear proper Goodyear Wide Tread GT white-letter tires, finishing off the period-perfect presentation in a big way. Beautifully finished and an absolute blast to drive, this is a high-quality Z/28 that probably counts as an investment but remains ready to drive. Don't miss this chance, call today!

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1968 Chevrolet Camaro\nHIGHLIGHTS 383V8 hooked up to a 5-speed manual transmission! Detroit Speed goodies! Menacing black street machine! BODY OVERVIEW The body is clean and straight, showing that this car has been cared for since the restoration and modifications took place. Professionally wrapped in matte black film, any imperfections would become immediately obvious. The body lines are crisp and sharp, and this Camaro is bound to turn some heads! The carbon fiber trunk spoiler adds to that classic muscle car look, while contributing to this Camaro's absolutely menacing demeanor. The carbon fiber mirrors and front splitter are the finishing touches that not only bring the look of this car together, but also act as a subtle touch to let passerby know that this is no $40,000 car. PAINT CONDITION OVERVIEW This Camaro was professionally wrapped matte black, and it looks really, REALLY good. Getting a good wrap done can be a challenge, and matte black especially has a higher potential to turn out poorly. The wrap was well done, and is in great condition. The door handles, locks, and brightwork are all black now as well. With all modifications performed in the last few years, it's no surprise what good condition everything is in! INTERIOR CONDITION OVERVIEW Step inside the Camaro, and suddenly it feels as if it is 1968 again-for a moment. The tasteful aftermarket steering wheel leads your eyes to the Phantom gauge overlays. A glance to the floor will show a shifter for the 5-speed manual transmission. The interior is in nice condition, with original style black vinyl and cloth houndstooth seat material. The modern radio in the dash works at should, and powers an impressive but not overpowering sound system ideal for miles of comfortable cruising. MECHANICAL OVERVIEW Under the hood sits a 383 V8 pushing just under 343hp to the rear wheels. When accounting for drivetrain loss, one can assume that the engine is somewhere in the 400hp-450hp range. The mechanics of this car are truly the bite to its bark! The exhaust is sure to perk up some ears when cruising around town, and the performance of this car certainly backs up that slick, menacing exterior look. You won't believe how well this car handles! Outfitted with a variety of high-quality Detroit Speed suspension components, this Camaro is smooth, tight, and goes where you point it. WHAT YOU'LL LOVE ABOUT THIS CAR This Camaro has a subtle but unique look. The quality cosmetic upgrades and the myriad of tasteful mechanical upgrades make this Camaro the ultimate cruiser!

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1966 Ford Mustang\n1966 Ford Mustang Fastback 1966 proved to be one of the most successful years for the Ford Mustang, accounting for over 20% of the first generation Mustang production. 607,568 Ford Mustangs rolled off Ford assembly lines for the 1966 model year to satisfy strong demand for the original Ponycar. Of these, only 27,809 were fastback editions. This body style has become the most sought after collectible in today's marketplace. It was on the fastback platform that Shelby created the legendary GT-350 Mustangs. Their street performance, competition & market success bolstered the Mustangs stature in period and this model preference has only increased as the collector mustang Market has blossomed. Born on September 20th, 1965, this Mustang has undergone an extensive restoration bringing it back to a new found glory with a little extra muscle versus how it left the Dearborn assembly plant. Retaining its original exterior color of Silver Frost and two-tone black and ivory appointments on the interior, the restoration stuck to exactly the way this stunning and wildly popular fastback rolled off the Dearborn assembly line with the exception of some add ons that will be covered below. Buckle up, grab your lasso and don your spurs, we're going to tame this wild pony! Exterior This car has it all with the fastback styling, vented B pillar, new for 1966 stainless steel rocker molding, hockey stick door and rear quarter coves, and 17-inch Shelby style wheels on all 4 corners. All this steel is draped in Silver Frost, and it is looking very good save for a few inclusions, some sanding scratches and areas of wavy body filler. All chrome on the bumpers is good, and covering theengine bay is a split scooped fiberglass hood. A look from the rear reveals the iconic triple vertical cluster of taillights, GT badged fuel filler cap, an added ducktail style spoiler extending onto the rear fenders, and a large curved rear greenhouse glass. The front of the car features the horizontally barred billet style grille fronting sandwiched between single round headlights. Interior A few liberties were taken on the interior during the restoration and we note a change from the warranty tag's 22 code interior indicating standard blue vinyl. Very clean looking buckets upfront, and a 2 plus 2 rear bench with smooth black bolsters and nice ivory horizontal tuck and roll inserts. This is the Pony interior, so we see the stitched galloping horses on the seat uppers. As an added bonus the rear seat folds flat for a little more cargo space. Riding the hump is a long armed chrome Hurst shifter with the obligatory T-handle and it has great 60's styling. The new for '66 dash, within a black camera case, holds updated black faced and white numbered gauges with a center mounted circular speedo, round side gauges, and is flanked by a 3 spoke black plastic steering wheel. In the center is a digital AM/FM radio and heater slides, and on the passenger's side is a black texture finished glovebox. Black carpet floods the floors and is very clean as well as the ivory vinyl headliner. A shout to the original looking nicely finished correct plaid covered trunk and original looking spare. Drivetrain Under the scooped hood lies a circa 1978 302ci V8 topped with a 4-barrel carburetor perched atop an Edelbrock aluminum intake and has a Toploader 4-speed manual attached to the back go of it. All dressed up in correct Ford blue along with some polished Ford racing valve covers and a chrome lidded air cleaner assembly. Things are looking good here but could use a quick detailing to bring things up to show level. Rounding out the drivetrain is a Ford 8 conventional rear axle weighing in with a 2.80 ratio. Undercarriage All extremely clean and virtually no road dirt and only slight surface rust on untreated components. Black undercoating is covering the floors which have had some replacement patches installed during the restoration. We can see independent coil spring front suspension working with a leaf spring rear arrangement and power disc brakes all around. A like new dual exhaust system fed by headers snakes its way rearward to glasspack mufflers before ending in turn down tips in front of the rear axle. Drive-Ability Like I was a kid all over again as my parents had a 1964-1/2 hardtop version, and I used to stand on the hump as we jetted down the road. Sitting in it brought back memories, and it performed great, handled the test track swimmingly with all functions operating as they should, and had some sweet acceleration! It earns its name but it's also fast forward. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase.Here's a classic car you can drive! Here we have a restored and highly sought after fastback version of the Ford Mustang. Stepped up a bit from the way it rolled off the assembly line and a great combination to boot. If you are in the market for a moderately priced classic, that starts right up, and runs smoothly, this is the car that should grace your garage. Leave the kids at home in front of the TV and enjoy the sound of kid silence, carve some corners and you have nothing but great conversation, and a smile on your face. 6F09C116129 6-1966 F-Dearborn, MI Assy Plant 09-Mustang Fastback C-289ci 2bbl 200hp V8 116129-Sequential Unit Number WARRANTY PLATE BODY 63A-Mustang Fastback, Standard Bucket Seats COLOR F-Silver Frost TRIM 22-Blue Standard Vinyl Buckets DATE 20J-September 20th DSO 41-Chicago AXLE 6-Ford 8 2.80 Conventional TRANS 6-C4 Automatic Classic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and collectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate controlled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8 acres!).

What you see or think you see on the big screen is not always reality! None of the Chargers used in the movie were ever actually powered by a blown Hemi engine, like they would like you to think. In reality, most, including this one, were powered by a Chevrolet 350 affixed with a fake blower. This particular Charger is screen used and was built for stunt purposes. It was also used for green screen shots where they would film the actors in front of the green screen, without the car actually moving. After the movie, the car was restored replacing any damaged parts with other screen used parts salvaged from another car. It was restored to high enough quality to actually be driven on the street. This car was acquired from a museum 8 years ago and has been in our collection all this years but is we are now looking to finish our new showroom and to fund it will let this iconic car go to a new Home. This is a car for the hard core FF lover, only few cars were made for the movie. Fully authenticated with movie production documentation and the actual builder of this cars for the Studios,John Wiser, who sadly passed in 2019 and we were fortunate to meet several times before he went to heaven. $199,900.00 1. or  text or WhatsApp +1.

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1969 Chevrolet Camaro\n1969 Chevrolet Camaro Hardtop In the United States, we have the ability to exercise our free will. And if that means modifying a car to our liking, so be it! And We The People have been doing that for quite some time with some of the earliest cultural transitions taking place in the hot rod era of the 50's. When Camaros came along, and survived, they became the canvases for expressions of artistic and performance interpretation by the hundreds. No, thousands! For consignment, a Camaro masterpiece. A '69 Camaro that was born in Norwood, Ohio and over the years received a makeover, heart transplant, new shoes, and many other goodies for show and go. It's a fantastic build and a striking car that's ready to save you from the time and money of restoring a barn find. This is turnkey goodness at its American best! Exterior There are not many color combinations as hot as black and red. And this red car features a matte black cowl hood with intersecting fender hash stripes on steroids! The grille is red, but the headlight bezels are black. The rear fascia picks up the matte black and is the ideal background for the Z/28 emblem and taillights. Take a close look at those smoked tail lights, the three sections are stacked and canted outward but face towards the rear, a bit of geometrical trickery that is often overlooked. With the use of 2 inch drop spindles, the car sits low over the 18-inch Ridler chrome 5-spoke wheels. The chrome bumpers and metal work around the car are in great shape. For flaws, we note some drips where an overzealous paint gun stayed too long, some rust on the lower pinch welds, a dent on one rocker panel and a scrape on one wheel arch. If you're not looking for these things, they're otherwise unobtrusive. Interior The black vinyl doors are lined with horizontal stitched lines in one inch rows. That pattern is mirrored in the front bucket seats and the rear bench. A Grant GT 3 spoke steering wheel is at the helm and is a vast ergonomic departure from the stock wheel. The square gauge pods now house round white faced gauges, backlit in blue and with digital readouts. An AM/FM/CD radio with USB and aux ports also adds blue light to the interior while four more gauges are perched on the center console canted towards the driver. A Hurst shifter takes its rightful place in the center in a carbon fiber trimmed base. Black loop carpet fills the foot wells where we also find some external speakers. The headliner is intact but could benefit from some freshening to tighten things up. Drivetrain A 383ci stroker V8 is under the cowled hood with an Edelbrock 1406 4-barrel carburetor sitting atop it. A Tremec T56 6-speed manual transmission rows the gears and sends power back to the 10-bolt rear with a 3.08 ratio. Power disc brakes are a definite upgrade and found at both ends. Hooker Super Comp headers get things started on the exhaust end of things. The car is also equipped with electric fans, an HEI distributor, and air conditioning. The engine bay is clean and show worthy with bright additions and flame engraved valve covers. Undercarriage Generally clean underneath but not on par with the top side of the car. There is surface rust in the usual places including the rear diff, suspension components, and the frame. Flaking rust is seen along the belly pan where it meets the rocker panels and there's a spot of invasive rust on a floor panel. Some residual oil on the oil pan and some oil on the rear diff coming from either the pinion seal or cover. The dual exhaust connects with an H pipe and continues twinning down the length of the car where they meet Flowmaster mufflers, then exit just beyond the rear fenders with only the very tips of the chrome tails showing. Independent suspension is in front with coil overs and leaf springs with traction bars are on the back. Our cnsignor also states air shocks are present. Drive-Ability Here we go, into the wild blue yonder, or in this case the wild black asphalt of our test loop. The car fires up with mucho gusto and like a hot tamale, rolls out onto the track. The seats are comfortable, the steering wheel provides confidence, and the Hurst shifter is the star of the show. We're able to monitor temperature and systems through a myriad of gauges, something not afforded to all Camaros in 1969. She runs strong, handles well, and stops on a dime. Oh, and sounds pretty darn good, too with the only flaw being reverse lights that don't illuminate. We can't wait to get this one back so we can put it on display for all to enjoy! Finished and well done Camaro projects with individual expressions and customizations don't usually last long at the mall. Someone took this canvas and painted a red rocket with black highlights, a strong engine, some modern conveniences, and a stance that is simply cool.

Designed by the man himself, Walt Disney, the Ford Rotunda was several blocks long and featured a few noteworthy Ford models but the primary focus was the multiple Mustangs in various body styles on display. Ford considered the first Mustang as a 1965 but due to its release date these early cars are now labeled by collectors as a 1964.5 to distinguish them from the later cars. They can be identified by the serial number range found in the VIN number. This extremely cool 1964 1/2 coupe is a very nicely built car that incorporates some original and customized features to make a very unique classic muscle car. The car was completely restored in 2021 and took around 2 years to complete. It has all new paint done in its original Poppy Red color with a a unique White center stripe and the GT style stripe down the sides. In that side stripe is custom MUSTANG lettering on the doors and the year on the front fenders. The chrome on the car is in great condition and it has its correct style new front/rear bumpers and also has the new trim for the faux rear brake scoop area. The exterior handles and mirrors were also all replaced. The exterior lights all work properly and all have been upgraded with more modern LEDs. The glass is in good condition throughout, has a slight tint and is framed in very nice stock style trim. The car has a great stance and rides on a set of very clean American Racing Torq Thrust wheels with custom red Mustang emblem center caps. The wheels and BF Goodrich Radial T/A (P225/60R15) tires are all new. 5F07F143473 5 - Year and includes 1964 F - Dearborn, Michigan 07 - Hardtop F - Optional 260ci V8 143473 - Range for 1964 F code is 100001-250000 The car is powered by its original 260 V8 motor that has been completely rebuilt. During the process it got a new carburetor, new chrome Ford Mustang valve covers, a new alternator (replacing generator), new Mustang air cleaner and was also mostly painted Blue. It has a ton of very nice modifications and under the hood it is fully show ready. It has the export brace set up with chrome shock tower mounts. Even the shocks tops are red for a real cohesive look and little details like using new red spark plug wires on the new distributor are a nice touch. The car has a great sound through the dual exhaust that is all brand new. Backing up the motor is an automatic C4 transmission that was rebuilt and shifts smoothly. From front to rear the car was fully gone through with all new brakes, a new chrome brake booster, new gas tank, new battery, new suspension bushings, etc. If it needed something, it got it, down to even small things like a new windshield wiper bag. The interior of the car looks great and is done in a very cool red with white combination. It has its original bucket seats that have been recovered and look great with a custom Mustang emblem embroidered on the back. This embroidery was also done on the center of the rear bench seat. A custom painted console is mounted between the front seats and fits with the look perfectly. The door panels are also a red/white combo and new with all new hardware. The carpet has been replaced with new and is done in red with black Mustang floor mats. The only thing that was left untouched was the original headliner as it was in good condition. The dash is very clean in all white with a matching dash pad, column and steering wheel. The AC system utilizes underdash mounted vents and blows cold. Other very cool features include the custom red/white lap belts and custom door sill plates. In the trunk it received all new black carpeting.

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1967 Ford Mustang\nI am the 3rd owner of this car that was originally sold by Smith Ford, Lordsburg New Mexico. It was built in San Jose CA and has been restored from ground up including taken back to bare metal and repainted in the original Silver Frost. The interior has been renewed to original spec. The engine is the original 200 ci straight six that came with the car new. It has been rebuilt to drive smoothly on today's roads and highways in that it has oversize valves with hardened seats to accommodate lead free gasoline. The carburetor has been updated to a Weber dual throat and has headers to breath properly through a 2.25 exhaust system. The distributor has been updated to a DUI electronic ignition and the plug wires are custom made from Magnecor. It has the original three (3) speed top loader transmission. Two years ago I had Classic Mustangs of Houston add power steering and Classic AutoAir air conditioning. From the outset the car looks mostly like it just came off the showroom and it is anideal cruiser. The car is for show....not go, if you know what I mean. This pony will turn heads and gets attention at car shows. The wheel trims are original with the car and inside the car the original AM radio is still there. Interior wise I have added 3 point seat belts and got rid of the dash pull parking brake for a hand brake between the seats. My son mounted the tachometer on a custom bracketthat he built on a 3D printer that looks like it was always there. All dash gauges have been rebuilt. I no longer drive it. Shesits in the driveway under cover and I'll wash it every now and then and take it along the Seawall to keep it running. It's time for someone else to enjoy it. The body is straight and essentially rust free, however, a little surface rust has popped up here and there but it's not deep. This is a greatcar to take to the next level if you're so inclined. A conversion to automatic would be a breeze and of course there are those who will fit a new Coyote V8 into it. I understand why as I have one in my F150. But in all honesty this is a great Sunday driver that you will need to park away from others when you take it shopping. Data plate info Body 65A, Color 4, Trim 2D, Date 24K, DSO 75, Axle 3, Trans 1.

Sporting a unique combination of Rally Sport front bumpers to go along with its strategically placed Super Sport badges, this F-body is one of a kind.

Just beyond that wheel sits a seven-pod gauge cluster, while an additional trio of auxiliary gauges is situated at the base of the console just beyond the staple-style gear selector. An aftermarket FM radio with an aux input uses front center and rear deck-mounted speakers to seamlessly blend a bit of modern tech without disrupting the retro vibes of this muscle Car. Under the aggressive cowl-induction hood, we find a 400 cubic-inch small-block V-8 topped with an Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor and matching Edelbrock intake manifold. A set of long tube headers feeds into a true dual exhaust, while a set of performance mufflers add a throaty growl that gives this muscle car the perfect tone to match its ferociously confident exterior.

Ford freaks and Mustang maniacs, your attention please! If you're searching for a classic Mustang unlike any other at the car show then listen up. The legendary Mach One Mustangs had a variety of engine options, however, for 1970 the 335hp 428ci Cobra Jet was the baddest on the block. And you may not know, but allegedly the 428s could take a Boss 429 in the stop light wars of the era. According to Ford savant and officially licensed verifier Kevin Marti (martiauto.com), this Wimbleton White pony is one of one. That's right say it with me, One of One. 1130 Mach Ones produced in 1970 featured the 428 CJ teamed with the bullet proof C6 automatic. Of those units only 125 were white - how many of those are on the road today? Drum roll please....according to Marti, this is the only 428CJ, automatic, white '70 Mach One with a special ordered AM radio. I know, but it's still cool to have the only Mach One ever made in this configuration. The documentation provided by the current owner also could indicate this car was built specifically for a Ford employee of the time. In the last few years, the current owner has installed new exhaust, sent the carburetor to Holley for a rebuild, and had the majority of the wiring replaced. Here's the bottom line folks, this is a special car. If you've been waiting for a unique Mustang to come up for sale then wait no further. This Cobra Jet is ready for launch.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You estimate prices of items. Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1968 Chevrolet Camaro\n1968 Chevrolet Camaro Hardtop In 1968, there were two subtle design cues that differentiated the 1968 from the 1967Camaro. First, the vent wing windows in the 1967 modelwere removed, and longer side windows took their place. Second, a rectangular side marker was added to the front fenders. In 1969, rear side fender vents were added. And that, my friends, is how to quickly tell the difference between first generation Camaros from the side.And we learned even more about the car when Camaro guru Jerry MacNeish was a guest on the Classic Auto Mall Show during season one, available on most podcast carriers. For consignment, a 1968 Chevrolet Camaro hardtop with unknown mileage but dressed in killer red with black stripes, resto-modded with a high performance V8 engine, and wearing taller shoes forged to look factory. Exterior Matador Red pops off the body like a fire engine and is augmented by wide, black painted stripes that run in tandem over the hood, decklid, and rear wing. A cowl hood bumps things up a notch and a custom billet grille takes the place of the cubed version. Marker lights have been moved to the front lower valance that tops a chin spoiler and this all presents a unique face to the '68. Beautifully polished 17-inch Chevrolet Rally wheels really create a great stance with deep dish holding 315 tires in back and low profiles all around. No front bumper, but the back one is in fine shape as is the metalwork and trim around the car. In fact, we could find no exterior imperfections. Interior The standard Camaro black vinyl door panels are super clean with window cranks at the ready. ProCar low back front bucket seats are in place and covered with charcoal cloth. The pattern is copied on the back bench where RJS racing harnesses are provided for the passengers and there's also a roll cage for added safety. A 3 spoke steering wheel leads to a custom gauge cluster with six AutoMeter white faced gauges in a painted black dashboard just beyond the polished and tilt steering column. In the center stack, a Kenwood AM/FM/CD with Bluetooth illuminates the cabin and Vintage Air controllers are just below. More glossy black faces the passenger from the dashboard and a B&M shifter rises confidently from the center hump. The low pile black carpet is in great shape and the headliner is clean and fully intact. Drivetrain Under the cowl hood, a spotless 350ci crate engine with aluminum heads, an Edelbrock intake manifold, electronic fuel injection, and headers. Backing it up is a TH400 3-speed automatic transmission sending power to a Ford 9 in back and providing the spark is an EZ EFI. Power disc brakes are supplied at all four wheels. Undercarriage Except for the occasional cobweb, it's nicely clean underneath. The dual exhaust runs from the header to an H-pipe and continues their journey to a pair of FlowMaster mufflers before dumping discreetly under the car in the back. Detroit Speed front arms and coil springs make up the suspension while Detroit Speed leaf springs live out back and the entire car has been dropped 2 . Drive-Ability We crank the crate to life and it lets the neighbors know it means business. The healthy bellow follows us onto the test loop where the car has obvious power underfoot, smooth straight tracking and excellent handling. Braking is on point and acceleration is just a foot tap away. We note the rear tail light and blinker is not working nor are the reverse lights. All other functions work as they should. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. Part grand tourer, part drag racer, all glorious! Hey kids, let's go for ice cream. Buckle your racing harnesses! . A fantastic looking, running, and feeling car with a comfortable interior and go anywhere engine. Chevrolet may not have been thinking about 17-inch wheels and aluminum heads for their daily driven Camaros back in the day, but it sure does enhance this classic car today. No pressure, but '68 Camaros consistently sell here at the mall, and well sorted examples like this don't last long. 124378N326969 1-Chevrolet 24-Camaro 37-2 Door Hardtop Sport Coupe 8-1968 N-Norwood, OH Assy Plant 326929-Sequential Unit Number TRIM TAG 10B-2nd Week October ST 68 12437-1968 Camaro 2 Door Hardtop Sport Coupe BDY NOR27112-Norwood Body # TR 712-Black Standard Vinyl Buckets PNT P2-Seafrost Green, Black Top Classic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and collectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate controlled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8 acres!).

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1968 Ford Mustang\n1968 Ford Mustang California Special Hardtop In mid February 1968, the California Ford dealers began to market a factory built, limited edition Mustang called the GT/CS, or California Special . It was born out of the need to spark interest in the model as the pony car craze began to blossom and when the Southern California sales manager saw the 1967 Shelby GT500 dubbed Little Red it sparked an idea for a special model that would appeal to Californians. The GT/CS was developed alongside the '68 Shelbys and in the end, 4,118 were produced. For consignment, a 1968 Ford Mustang California Special hardtop with a title verified 49,920 actual miles and a 289ci V8 under the hood. This one has the black vinyl top and some Shelby stylings that although did not spur the sales numbers Ford was looking for, it did create a special Mustang that is collectible today. Exterior Candy Apple Red paint is augmented with black California Special striping that travels the midline and terminates on the rear side scoops and also lines the back end of the rear spoiler. In front, Lucas fog lights live in the horseless blacked out grille while a pair of hood pins and Shelby style hood vents decorate the top surface. Both chrome bumpers are in great shape and the rest of the metalwork is nice as well. Our notchback has a black vinyl roof in good condition and a California Special script emblem on each rear quarter panel. Shelby style tail lights flank a pop off gas cap and reverse lights are round units on the rear valance. 15-inch Weld DragLite wheels now occupy the hubs and we note one of them is bent. Other imperfections include numerous scratches, chips, cracking body work, bubbling, some gap fitment issues, and a triple scratch in the black stripe. Interior Black vinyl door panels have a woodgrain strip inside the pleated patterned insert which shows a bit of waviness on the doors and some separation on the driver's side. Low back bucket seats have textured and pleated inserts, all in good condition, and the black vinyl continues on the back 2+2 seating where we find one window crank off its mount. A wood rimmed 3 spoke steering wheel shares the column with an AutoMeter tachometer in front of the wood applique lined dashboard and standard gauge package. An updated Mustang branded AM/FM/Cassette radio is in the center and warm woodgrain applique covers the dash in front of the passenger and above the glove box. A Hurst shifter is floor mounted with a rubber boot and surrounded by loop style carpet in good shape and a center console with armrest and cupholders has been added. An overhead console stretches to the back of the car adorned with more woodgrain applique and the headliner itself looks to be in very good condition. The trunk is clean and painted and houses a fuel cell. Drivetrain Under the hood is a 289ci V8 with a Holley 4-barrel carburetor and a T5 5-speed manual transmission sending power to the Ford 9 in back. Disc brakes are found on the rear wheels and drums in front. Headers begin the exhaust process in this clean engine bay which features a chrome shock tower brace, Monte Carlo bar and valve covers. Undercarriage Driver quality underneath with its fair share of surface rust in the usual areas. The dual exhaust enters FlowMaster mufflers after an H-pipe and then dumps under the car. The driveshaft runs through a loop on its way to the back while coil spring suspension is employed up front and a 4 link with coilovers are out back. There's one spot of invasive rust on the inside rear quarter panel. Drive-Ability We'll head west with this one and take the California Special on a test run. The 289 with headers and short exhaust creates a little earthquake of sound under the seats and the car rolls around the track like a mudslide, smoothly. We surf the gears and ride a wave of acceleration which is quite good and the brakes stop the car like rush hour on the 405. As far as functionality, the left rear turn signal doesn't blink, the reverse lights do not illuminate, and the fog lights don't work. Minor dysfunctions from something with California in the name. Everything else worked as intended. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. While not fully original, this is a real California Special and when was the last time you saw one? These are really quite rare and until tributes were produced by Ford in 2007 and subsequent years. We're thrilled to have one in our Hallowed Halls with low mileage and a Marti Report that comes with it. Take the 15 to the 40 and head east to the PA Turnpike, then get off at the Morgantown exit.

Here's a breakdown of the 1967 Camaro RS's history Born from the Mustang's Success In 1964, Ford's Mustang became a runaway hit, and Chevrolet scrambled to create a competitor. The Camaro, built on the upcoming Chevy II Nova platform, arrived in showrooms by fall of 1966. The RS Package All About Appearance The RS wasn't a performance package like the SS (Super Sport). It focused on aesthetics, offering a sportier look for the base Camaro. The key feature of the 1967 Camaro RS was the hidden headlights. They retracted electrically behind motorized panels in the grille, creating a cleaner, more aerodynamic front end. Other RS additions included distinctive front grille inserts, special taillight lenses, and RS badges. Sharing the Spotlight The RS package could be combined with the SS package, creating an RS/SS Camaro. In this case, the RS badging took precedence visually. 1967 was the only year for the unique center console design and instrument cluster layout offered in the Camaro A Strong Debut, but Not the Sales Leader While the 1967 Camaro, including the RS, was a success, it couldn't dethrone the Mustang in sales that year. Chevy sold 220,906 Camaros compared to Ford's 472,121 Mustangs However, the Camaro, including the RS, did chip away at Mustang's dominance, paving the way for future sales victories.

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1966 Ford Mustang\n1966 Ford Mustang Convertible Having only recently been introduced to the public, the first gen Mustangs seem to have changes made to design aspects nearly every year, some drastic, others subtle. From 1965 to 1966, a few subtle exterior items changed included the door scoops which were done with a 3 bar, black and chrome variant in 1966, the vertical bar through the running horse on the grille was gone in 1966 and the grille itself went from honeycomb design to vertical and horizontal bars, and back up lights were standard for 1966 and optional for 1965, so if you don't see them chances are it's a 1965. For consignment, a 1966 Ford Mustang convertible, driven just 500 miles since a total restoration was done to showroom specifications according to our consignor, and the restorer managed a body shop at a Ford dealership, so you know specs were checked. Photos of the restoration will accompany this car. Exterior This hue of sky blue is known as Acadian Blue and it's here in two stage form. The familiar face of this classic features the new grille for 1966 and the horse in the corral above a nicely chromed front fender with lower supports that waterfall down on a body colored lower fascia. The tell tale door scoops or faux quarter panel vents are affixed at the termination of the body crease detail and the tail end trails off with the smooth, short panels of the rear fenders. Looking at the back reveals an instantly recognizable tail which cannot be confused for any other classic. The triple tail lights, the center gas cap, the body colored valance, and another good showing of a chrome bumper means Mustang, pure and simple. Our wheels here are 14-inch with wire wheel covers and faux knockoffs wearing tires with an early 2021 production date. Up top we have a white canvas top with clear plastic window in great condition and with the top down, a medium blue tonneau cover finishes the appearance and is also in great condition. All chrome and metal work is in fantastic condition. Imperfections include some apparent panel gap alignment issues and some damaged paint in one of those gaps. Interior Vinyl clad door cards contrast dark blue and light blue, showing some discoloration on the lighter part, but the center inserts are in very good condition. Two tones are carried onto the seats where light blue surrounds tuck and roll inserts in darker blue, textured vinyl and none of the seats, including the back bench appear to have any damage or wear whatsoever. A blue 3 spoke steering wheel with horn buttons on each occupies the column which traces down to the elongated oval dash that houses five gauges including the large speedometer front and center. Over the top a dark blue dash cover is sculpted around the radio, in this case an AM/FM unit while a bank of four round vents is mounted under the dash in another oval design. Oval also dictates the shape of the glove box and from there, we note the Mustang T-shifter in the center console on a plastic and metal tray base that shows a touch of patina but is in fine shape. Blue loop carpet with vinyl inserts occupies the driver's footwell and the carpet continues throughout. A loose fitting but period correct plaid mat covers the sizable trunk. Drivetrain Show worthy clean and tidy, the engine bay holds a 200ci inline 6 cylinder engine with Ford blue painted parts and clean connections and hoses. A 1-barrel carburetor sits on top and a C4 3-speed automatic transmission is mounted behind and sends power to the Ford 7.25 rear with 3.20 conventional gears. The car is equipped with power disc brakes with slotted and drilled discs in the front and power drums in the rear. Undercarriage A lovely flat black covers the underside which is as clean as can be. If it was driven 500 miles since the restoration, you certainly can't tell from the underside. There's no surface rust, oil, or grease build up to report, so let's go over the major features. The clean single exhaust meets a stock style muffler then terminates before reaching the bumper and is not visible from the outside. Suspension consists of coil springs in the front and leaf springs in the rear. Drive-Ability Smooth surfaces on the inside are quintessentially 60's and it's all a bit slick compared to the materials used in modern cars, and that's a big part of the charm. She starts right up and we take a lap in this blue beauty where it performs wonderfully. This is clearly a cruiser, not a racer, and provides some wonderful open air fun with all functions working, save for the horn. With the top down, you'll be able to yell Let's go, buddy, the light is green! . While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. It's refreshing to see a 1966 Mustang with the 120 horsepower inline 6 still in the car! In many circles, the original configuration is more desired than a modified engine bay where the six is pulled to make room for an eight. This car represents a common spec with more than 70,000 convertibles produced, often with the inline 6 and automatic transmission.

I chose Neil at B&N Hotrods in Maple Ridge, British Columbia, Canada because of their high quality of builds that I have seen. I knew they were to ones to build it because of their attention to detail in their builds. Having traveled to Utah to see Dave Kindig of KINDIG-It DESIGNS, also from the T V show Bitchin Rides, I knew I wanted more than just a Hotrod, I wanted a one of a kind Hotrod/Show car. Everything on this car is and will be custom, but it will still be a Dodge Charger at first glance, The heavy lifting work is done on the car with all the body metal work 90% finished and the metal work inside, ie floors and so on being ready for final fit.There are a ton of parts for the car that come with it as I have purchased a lot and basically the car is at the stage of final assembly and Paint and interior. I realize for the car to get to the finish line and be what it is intended to be, I must allow someone else to get it to its final destination as probably one of the nicest chargers ever built. I would suggest getting the car completed by Neil and his crew at B&N Hotrods as he already has the vision to make this car what it should be. His contact info can be requested by any serious inquiries on the car. Chassis The body is sitting on an Art Morrison custom muscle car chassis, specially built by Morrison to handle the immense power this car will generate. With fully independent rear suspension which includes a Dana 60 with 4 10 gears. Rear brakes are 14.25\u201d- 4 piston Wilwood disks with Pirelli 405/25/R24 P zero tires on 24\u201dx 15\u201d Foose Knuckle Rims. The front suspension is Morrison\u2019s custom upper and lower control arms with ZR1 Corvette hub assembly and spindles, again with Wilwood 15\u201d- 6 piston discs with Pirelli 265/30/R22 P Zero tires on 22\u2019 X 9\u201d Foose Knuckle rims. This chassis set up is one of a kind and every detail has been considered for ultimate handling and ride performance. Engine Twin turbo 572 all Aluminum HEMI built by Nelson Racing Motors out of Chatsworth CA. Currently set up for break in tune at 1005 hp and 924 ft lbs torque at 6 psi of boost. Last dyno pull reached 1731 hp and 1494 ft lbs torque at 19 psi of boost. Engine is currently set up with four different tunes starting at 1005hp up to 1731hp, four separate tunes at the turn of a tune setting key. Engine is fully capable of 2500 \u2013 3000hp and max boost of 40 psi. Transmission is an American Power Train T56Magnum 6 speed manual with cryogenically hardened gears. In a conversation with Tom Nelson, he told me that this is the newest version of the 572 twin Turbo Hemi and has all the newest upgrades and modifications and in his words \u201cthe best Hemi he has built to date\u201d An upgrade from the motor in the 68 Charger called Maximus, built by Nelson Racing engines. Engine and transmission were installed by B & N Hotrods out of Maple Ridge, British Columbia, Canada. B & N has done all the work on the car to date and are doing amazing work with this car. Neil at B & N has spent time at Nelson Racing while the motor was on the dyno. Rust Free There is absolutely no rust on the car as it has a new and complete chassis. The body was stripped down to bare metal and all unsatisfactory body panels have been replaced, starting with the rear quarters, the corner caps which normally bolt on, have been properly welded on to the rear corners so there is no longer any seam for a smother look. The trunk lid has also been replaced with a new one. One door needed to be replaced as it was not up to quality standards as well as one front fender. The rockers on both sides are new. All flooring including the trunk is new custom fabrication from B & N Hotrods as required with the new chassis from Art Morrison. The metal work is of the highest quality workmanship and after four tours of the custom car builder Dave Kindig of the TV show Bitchin Rides shop, the work from B & N is on par with that same quality.

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1972 Chevrolet Camaro\n1972 Chevrolet Camaro Hardtop Drag racing was born in the dry lake beds in the California deserts. In the 1930s as engines got better and drivers got braver, speeds began topping 100mph. But it wasn't until after World War II that a bunch of kids with cars, hanging out with nowhere in particular to go, turned into something more serious. Popularity grew steadily but drag racing still remained largely an underground pastime. Races frequently took place on disused military runways with the first organized event dating back to 1949 at the Goleta Air Base in California. As the decade turned drag racing began to get organized. The National Hot Rod Association, (NHRA), was founded in 1951 by Wally Parks, and within the decade two classes of competition had developed 'Unmodified Stock' and 'Top Eliminator'. For consignment a 1972 Camaro, highly modified to get the lowest ET possible in a straight line race. Plenty of power, a mostly original looking 1972 car, but do not be fooled, this Camaro rocks and knocks off socks. Sporting a worked to the nines 660+hp 496ci V8, a Ford 9 axle and 6,260 non verifiable miles on the updated instrument cluster. This Camaro is ready, willing and able to hand out an ass kicking at the drop of a hat...or arm for that matter. Exterior With a Dark Blue Metallic respray on this street legal straight liner has plenty of spit shine left on the steel. Exterior gaps are good, and panels remain straight but the paint does show with a few chips and battle scars on the lowers of the body. A large rear facing hood scoop allows for plenty of nostrils for the inhale and the power plant just under. Chrome hood pins lead the way at the front of the hood which has taken on a somewhat Trans Am look with a V front grille, single headlights and round parking/signal lighting just next to the grille. Front split bumpers are mirror-like, and all trim remains very nicely preserved. Starting in 1970, began the years when GM began to change the design of the Camaro, and blurred the lines between a Camaro and a Pontiac, give a gaze to the front of the car and it will pan out! Not a true beak but certainly features that resemble each other. 15-inch polished Weld DragLite wheels are wrapped with 215/65/R15's in front, and with 275/60R15 on the rear. Bringing up the rear of the car is a small spoiler, another shiny chrome bumper and the round tail lighting. Interior A swing of the doors and we see some slight modification to the interior, starting with a full 6-point roll cage, correct Camaro black vinyl bucket seats with 4-point harnesses, and some Autometer gauges to replace the factory ones, all mounted within a carbon fiber bezel in the stock black dash. Plenty of toggles to play with in the center and nice black carpet covers the floors. Other highlights include a Hurst shifter in the power window toggle equipped console, Grant rally steering wheel, and an interesting combo of street racer and creature comforts. All this sits between original door panels right out of 1972 that have been fitted with polished aluminum lower sections. A shout to the trunk where the fuel cell and battery now resides. Drivetrain A pristine and highly polished huge 496ci Chevrolet V8 is stuffed under the hood. This money shot marvel of racing engineering containa Callies forged crank, Crower forged rods, and a Comp Cams .710i/.680eroller cam which uses roller lifters. It sports Brodix aluminum heads with Jesel 1.7 roller rockers, and a Brodix intake. Fossils flow freely through a single Holley 4-barrel carburetor. Strapped to the back is a 3-speed TH400 automatic which has an ATI 8 stall converter, a reverse manual valve body and a trans brake. The rear axle is a hefty Ford 9 unit with Richmond gears, and a MarkWilliams spool and Mark Williams axles. I assure you kids, we are NOT screwing around with this powerhouse! Undercarriage Independent coil springs featuring tubular front control arms, and for the rear, leaf springs with Cal Track bars. All disc brakes for this racer and for the exhale we have headers which flow into a Magnaflow exhaust. Breathe deep, now exhale! Woosh... Drive-Ability Yes! Yes! Yes! It definitely drives, it certainly starts, and it offers up plenty of ear candy when the throttle is pushed. Climbing in is a bit much for this old writer, but once in it is comfortable, and all is working well. Definitely an all polished like a shiny apple, eager to give a teaching lesson to a lesser vehicle who dares to step up to the line. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. At first glance an original 1972 style Camaro with some interesting wheels and a big rear facing scooped hood. But if we dig deeper, there is plenty of extra blood, sweat and tears that went into this car on the mechanical front, and if remotely interested, you should have a gander at the specs, which are well documented. The dyno sheet says she'll put out 666 horsepower.

What a crime to waste it on children. . It was the car to have if you were seeking the fountain of youth. The 1965 Ford Mustang was the car to have if you were looking to win over your neighbor or hit the road for fun and adventure. It was also a must have for enthusiastic drivers and car enthusiasts who simply liked to drive. For consignment, a 1965 example of the very popular Ford Mustang from the first yearand in hardtop form with 127,919 title verified actual miles on the odometer. Purchased by our consignor, the third owner and treated to a full on restoration in 2008 make for one great driving, simple to work on 6 cylinderpony with a manual transmission. A driver's driver if you will, complete with all its receipts over the years and even retaining thebuild sheet and original salesman's business card. A nice redux in the correct factory paint color and a beautiful interior which is clean and basic yet functional. One of the great examples here donning the halls of Classic Auto Mall. Exterior Driver quality plus sultry Rangoon Red paint drapes the straight steel panels of this car. A few inclusions and minor bubbles are seen on the lowers of the doors and there are grinding marks in the bumper where a bolt head was cut out in the past. Overall shiny and nice red paint over straight steel panels that are minding their gaps make up the body. Up front, flanking the galloping Mustang badge are the single headlights in the faux vented inserts. Like new chrome, correct and very nice badging, the hockey stick cove with the chromed trim on the rear quarter and clean lines running the length of the body. With shiny standard issues 14-inch wheel covers, this first year Mustang has you arriving in style and class. Deeply treaded 205/70R14 thin white stripe radials wrap those snazzy chrome wheels. Interior With nearly every part of a 1st generation Mustang interior available from a catalog it's hard to tell these days what's original and what'sreplaced. But I can tell you this, the interior before us is clean, mean and looking just fine. Red ribbed vinyl door cards grace the textured steel door shells and are dressed with chrome for the cranks. Slipping inside leads our posteriors to a pair of red tuck and roll and smooth vinyl lowback bomber style buckets, all in excellent condition, nice and tight, and show no signs of wear. A matching bench is in the rear and appears as nice as the buckets. Red carpet, clean and like new, floats this interior and is protected by ribbed red rubber mats up front and holds the chrome T-handle shifter on the hump. In front, this dash is all original with the central speedometer, and a single flanking circular gauge cluster on either side. A factory steering wheel is in front of this dash, showing a few cracks, and as we pan right, an original AM radio is inserted and installed into the center. A note to the trunk space with the plaid vinyl liner,tools in the correct bag, and full size spare.. Drivetrain Under the hood we see a very nicely restored and rebuilt 200ci inline 6 cylinder. It is in a really clean black engine bay with the engine painted Ford Black and contrasting red painted valve cover and air cleaner to compliment the black. On top is a 1-barrel carburetor and nice supple rubber hoses and no corrosion can be seen under this hood. On back is a 3-speed manual transmission which sends power to a 7.25 rear axle weighing in with 3.20 gears. Undercarriage Overall very nice underneath, clean black paint, surface rust on the usual suspects, solid floor pans and toe kicks and rockers. We note the flooring has been replaced in the past, there are a few small repairs to the shock towers, and there is the beginnings of invasive rust on the rear of the right front unibody rail. Drum brakes are on all 4 corners and we note independent coil spring suspension up front and leaf springs in the back. Bottom inside of the doors are clean, and the thresholds are looking good. Single exhaust is on in stock form and looking good, albeit with some surface rust. Drive-Ability A very easy starter with a smooth idle during warmup. Off to the test track, and here at said track, this car performed flawlessly. Nice smooth acceleration, tight steering, and bias free panic stopping. Shifting was a breeze with the manual, and cruising at highway speed proved no problem for the 6 cylinder under the hood. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase.

Marti Report verified as a genuine 1 of 1, only car like this ever made. Today it has a 4V Holley which makes this car like any other S Code. The car was fully restored and engine rebuilt right before I bought it in 2014. It seems to have a sporty cam and some additional power from the rebuild.Since that time I had two kids and it has mostly lived in my garage in a Car Capsule (that I will include) and I only drive it very occasionally or just start it once a month to keep the fluids moving. It has less than 1,000 miles since I have owned it. The interior is excellent with only a few modern upgrades including retractable shoulder belts and modern radio that looks vintage. New instrument bezel and lens, 67-68 center console, new dash pad, new carpeting and mats. Seats are excellent, rear fold down seats work and look great. Trunk is fully furnished with original style plaid mats and covers and comes with a jack, jumper cables, and some other maintenance items.

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1967 Chevrolet Camaro\n1967 Chevrolet Camaro RS/SS Hardtop Tribute RS on a Camaro speak stands for Rally Sport which was a cosmetic package available on all trim levels. It included hidden headlights, and reverse lights below the bumper, as well as a few other options. When matched with the SS performance package, you had a mean looking Camaro that could perform as well as it looked. For consignment, a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro sport coupe dressed up as an RS/SS showing 18,003 non-verifiable miles on the odometer. While a clone would have the correct engine and other mechanical and cosmetic mimicry, a tribute takes certain parts and gives a proverbial nod to that model. That's not to say our car has not had some tasteful upgrades and along with RS components, represents a great car for your consideration. The engine, transmission and rear were rebuilt 2,000 miles ago according to our consignor and a new wiring harness is on board to distribute the amps. Exterior Two stage Bolero Red paint is complemented by a black SS nose stripe with SS emblems filling the break in the stripe. An SS emblem is also on the grille which is flanked by matching headlight covers in true RS fashion. The cowl hood extends high over the vents, held in place by locking hood pins, and the windshield leads to a black vinyl top in excellent condition. The chrome bumpers and metalwork are in great condition and so is the SS gas cap on back under a racy rear spoiler. 15-inch Chevrolet Rally wheels are on board here with staggered size tires that contribute to the raked stance of the car. A tasteful black pinstripe ends on the door with a black bowtie and a 327 crest is on the front quarter panel. Overall, the paint and exterior condition is in great condition, and we could not find any glaring exterior flaws. Interior Simple black door cards welcome occupants of the car with typical features and Camaro plaques on each door. Black vinyl buckets seats are in very good condition and the back seats are equally as nice. A black padded steering wheel rim surrounds four plastic spokes, and the column provides the mounting base for a tachometer and oil pressure light. Twin coves house the speedometer on the left while black plastic backs the center stack that houses the vent controls and AM/FM/Cassette radio and a triplet gauge pod is mounted under the dash. A Hurst shifter with a chrome ball handle serves as the joystick and like the entire center console, is in great shape. Black loop style carpet covers the floor along with vintage style Camaro rubber mats, while a stitched black headliner is clean and intact. Drivetrain Just as the fenders say, a rebuilt 327ci power plant sits proudly and in the very clean engine bay. Fuel is brought in by a 4-barrel carburetor and a Muncie M20 4-speed manual transmission sends power to the rear wheels where the 10 bolt axle is found. The engine bay is replete with polished metal and coated headers, while red ignition wires add some color and match the block. A gold brake booster assists with sending fluid to power disc brakes in the front with drilled and slotted rotors and power drums in the rear. Undercarriage Very clean and dry underneath, uniformly black and only hints of minimal surface rust. The dual exhaust comes from the headers and links to an H-pipe before meeting up with a pair of Flowmaster mufflers and exhaust, finally dumping inconspicuously behind the bodywork and out of sight. Coil springs occupy the front independent suspension while leaf springs are found in the back with traction bars added. Drive-Ability We headed out onto the loop in this red tribute and even the world's biggest geek will gain coolness points by simply piloting this timeless classic. The car had good acceleration and braking, and the slightly raked stance and upright ride provides good visibility. Handling is not too shabby, and all functions operate as they should. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. A beautiful and powerful rebuilt power plant along with spectacular paint make this Camaro worthy of your consideration. Add the RS elements and SS badging, and you have an attention getting street machine which retains its classic status among some of the most iconic American cars. More than 34,000 SS models were built in '67, but good luck finding, (or bankrolling), a real deal RS/SS.

By this time, sales of the revolutionary Corvair lagged amid negative press, and Chevrolet needed a new\u2014but conventional\u2014 car to fill the segment. In September of 1966, the new Camaro made its debut, and finally, GM fans had a mid-size sporty car to be proud of. Like the competition from Dearborn, the Camaro offered a wide range of engine options stretching from the economical 230 cubic inch inline six on through to the mighty 396 cubic inch big block. Like its cross-town pony car rival from Ford, the Chevrolet Camaro is one of the cornerstones of the collector car hobby, with vast aftermarket support and legions of loyal fans around the world. RB Collection is proud to offer this 1967 Chevrolet Camaro SS coupe. This car comes to us from a collector in Germany and it was fully restored in America in 2013. This iconic vehicle checked off quite a few boxes on the option sheet, including the SS equipment pack with louver trim in the hood, badging, and the SS hood stripe in white; 396 cubic inch V8, 4-speed manual transmission, center console, and AM radio. Under the hood, the heart of the 1967 Camaro 396 is a roaring 6.5-liter V8 engine, delivering a jaw-dropping 375 horsepower (L78). Its immense power is further enhanced by a four-barrel carburetor, providing instant acceleration and an exhilarating driving experience. This engine is perfectly paired with a four-speed manual transmission, allowing drivers to take full control of the car's power and shift gears with ease. The original factory Marina Blue paint looks fantastic on this car, which still presents it in outstanding condition. The body is crisp, with straight panels and consistent, factory-appropriate gaps. Inside, one of the first things you'll notice is that every bit of factory-correct Deluxe bright blue vinyl is in pristine condition nicely matching the exterior color, and the white stripe in the Deluxe seating completes the fully coordinated and very correct package. The ribbing on the Deluxe door panels matches the texture of the low-back bucket seats, and in between them is the desirable center console with all gauges working perfectly. The 1967 Chevrolet Camaro 396 is a classic muscle car that represents the epitome of power and style from the golden era of American automobiles. With its aggressive design and powerful engine, this iconic Camaro is an undeniable presence on the road and a masterpiece for any serious collection. At Ruozzi Brothers Collection, fine automobiles are our passion. Our hands-on approach and personal service set us apart from the typical volume dealer. Realize your dream of driving the classic car you always wanted and join our fast-growing family of satisfied clients around the world!

For the first time, the Mustang?s engine bay was enlarged and now capable of housing Ford?s powerful 390 CI FE-Series big block V-8 engine. Today, these S-Code, big-block cars are highly sought-after by Mustang collectors for their strong power delivery and upscale, Grand Touring character.Clearly benefiting from restoration and 31 years of care under the prior ownership, this factory S Code 1967 Ford Mustang Convertible is a handsome example from the first year of availability for the 320 horsepower, 390 CI big-block V-8 engine. Built in December 19, 1966, this Mustang was one of just 1,825 Mustangs produced in Code W Clearwater Aqua paint and 1 of 1,099 with the aforementioned Paint code and the Code 2K Aqua Vinyl Standard bucket-seat interior. It was far rarer with its 1 of 106 powertrain, comprising the S Code 390 CI V-8 engine and Code 1 3-speed manual transmission, the latter of which has been subsequently upgraded to a 4-speed manual transmission. Built at Ford's Metuchen, New Jersey assembly plant, this Mustang was ordered from Ford Motor Company's Washington DSO (District Sales Office) and then sold new at Lamar Sloan Ford INC in Winchester, Virginia. Currently, the odometer reads 84k miles at the time of writing. Other highlights include a factory tachometer, dual exhaust system, and a newly installed set of chrome 15x7 Styled Steel Wheels mounting a fresh set of 1960s-style Firestone F70x15 tires. Importantly, this Mustang's original fender tag remains intact and in place. A Deluxe Marti Report confirms the vehicle's factory data and production statistics, plus original equipment and options including the potent S Code powerplant.

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1965 Ford Mustang\n1965 Ford Mustang Hardtop Since it was introduced 4 months before the normal start of the 1965 production year the earliest Mustangs were referred to as the 1964.5 model by enthusiasts. Nevertheless, all 1964.5 cars were given a 1965 standard VIN at the time of production. Production began in March 1964 and serial number 1, (5F08F100001), was sold on April 14th, 1964 at the George Parsons Ford dealership in St. John's Newfoundland, Canada. The official introduction followed on April 17th at the 1964 World's Fair. The gentleman whose name will be forever written in Mustang history was Captain Stanley Tucker. He walked into George Parsons Ford and found an all too eager salesman who sold him the car....3 days before the model officially went on sale. The rest, as they say, is history. We honor the service of Vietnam veterans, who at the time of the war, were at the age of buying their first car. Some bought one before they were drafted, others bought one immediately upon their return. Many others did not make it home. Here's a veteran who bought a yellow mustang before he was drafted. He abruptly sold it to his parents and upon his return, for whatever reason, they would not sell it back. Fast forward to 2014 when a loving wife purchased a car of the same year in the same color to celebrate his retirement. We say every car at the mall has a story to tell. That's a good one. Classic Mustangs are some of the most recognizable and popular classic cars that come through our hallowed halls, and this one is a fine driver that will elicit looks and conversations for many years to come. Restoration receipts and details will accompany this car. Exterior Looking like a Palomino horse, this Mustang wears Phoenician Yellow paint and has a Parchment vinyl roof. This car has the GT fog lights inset in the grille and wire wheel hubcaps on 14-inch steel wheels. The '65's had the optional reverse lights to the rear valance below the bumper where we also find a pair of chrome tips on the tailpipe. The black pinstripe along the shoulder line accentuates the body lines of the car. The paint, metal trim and bumpers, and vinyl top are absolutely presentable, and the panels are straight. It has a touch of patina that is a welcome change from pristine show cars you would be hesitant to drive more often. This one is a driver! Imperfections include some scuffs and scratches, chips, some bubbling, and cracks in the paint. Interior The black vinyl door panels are immaculate and the vinyl bucket seats and rear bench are in great shape. Molded plastic interior trim pieces in the back and in the footwells look great. The 3-spoke steering wheel wrapped in a vinyl aftermarket grip shows some patina but is complete with Mustang center cap. The gauge cluster features a horizontal speedometer to 120 mph flanked by round gauges for temp, gas level, and other important information. A JVC AM/FM/Cassette radio looks right at home in the center of the dash, and a large glove box is positioned under the dash cover in front of the passenger. A standard Mustang shifter takes its place on the floor, surrounded by black loop style carpet in great shape. The headliner shows a bit of age but is tight and undamaged. Trunk is clean and lined with the common plaid mat. Drivetrain A 289ci V8 is under the hood, fed by a 4-barrel carburetor and tied to a C4 3-speed automatic transmission. The engine was factory rated at 225 horsepower which was transferred to the rear wheels via a Ford 8 rear and 3.00 gears with limited slip. Power drum brakes are supplied on all four wheels. We would categorize the engine bay as driver quality and original looking with the exception, of course, of the yellow Optima battery. Undercarriage Driver quality under here as well with its fair share of surface rust on the leaf springs, rear axle, and other uncoated metal. The shock towers have been repaired in the past and photos of the welding are included in the photo set. Things are relatively dry underneath with just a bit of residual oil on the pan but does not appear to be actively leaking. The dual exhaust flows underneath where they meet a pair of stock style mufflers, the exit out the back. Independent front suspension with coil springs is noted and leaf springs are in the back. Drive-Ability We primed the carb and turned the key and the venerable 289 started up and sang a sweet song from the exhaust. We headed out on the test loop and checked functionality. Everything seemed to work, and the car ran and stopped well. Fifty years after original Mustang ownership, this car fulfilled a dream for someone. Surely, there are others out there who dream of owning a classic Mustang and whether you leave this one as is and drive the heck out of it or take advantage of its great bones and do a full restoration, you'll definitely be the fortunate steward of a great car with a moving story that goes with it. 5F07A253327 5-1965 F-Dearborn, MI Assy Plant 07-Mustang Hardtop A-289ci 225hp 4bbl V8 253327-Sequential Unit Number WARRANTY PLATE BODY 65A-Mustang Hardtop, Standard Bucket Seats COLOR A-Raven Black TRIM 26-Standard Black Vinyl Buckets DATE 04H-August 4th DSO 23-Philadelphia AXLE A-Ford 8 3.00 TracLoc TRANS 5-4 Speed Manual Classic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and collectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate controlled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8 acres!).

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1971 Ford Mustang\n1971 Ford Mustang Mach 1 Despite having just given the 1969 Mach 1 a facelift with a brand new front fascia in the 1970 model year, Ford already had plans for a complete revamp in 1971. Much of what made a Mach 1 unique was cosmetic in nature while four engine options were available, and five transmission choices were on the list. This generation was produced only from 1971 to 1973 and as we remember, Ford downsized the line with the Mustang II's in 1974. For consignment, a 1971 Ford Mustang Mach 1 wearing black side stripes. 36,498 Mach 1's were built in 1971 and while they were available in a variety of colors. Ford chose a Light Pewter Metallic example as their cover car on the 1971 Mustang sale brochure. Exterior Single stage Light Pewter Metallic is a fine shade of satin gray on this big fastback. The honeycomb grille contains inset sport driving lights and a chrome ring between single headlights. Color keyed bumpers could have been had in '71 but this car retains chrome front and rear, both in good condition. Functional dual ram hood scoops were Mach 1 specific, and Ford described them as being NASA type. On this car, they are within the wide black stripe the coats much of the hood center and part of a long hood. But it's not as long as the flat roof that gently slopes back blending seamlessly into the flat back window, past the Mach 1 wing, and then a 90 degree drop onto the vertical rear valance. There we find the honeycomb pattern repeated with a pop open gas cap between two trapezoidal and flush tail lights just above protruding rectangle exhaust tips. 15-inch Shelby 10 Spokes wheels are a nice touch on this car as Mach 1's were often equipped with dog dish hubcaps. Mach 1 Mustang is emblazoned on the front quarter panels. Flaws we note are some chipping paint on the black rocker panel, evidence of repair near a wheel opening, headlight surround, C-pillar, and door gap, a ding under the side stripe, various scratches, water spots, and imperfections in the paint and stripes. Interior Molded black plastic door panels feature integral pull handles and armrests with woodtone applique' panels. Some of the power window buttons are out of place and the speaker screen is missing. The tall front bucket seats include three colors of vinyl, knitted in the center and having accent stripes like suspenders up the middle. A tear is noted on the driver's seat bottom and some wear marks on the side bolster at the entry point. The rear 2+2 seats are deep and low while the rear shelf is an upright panel with a pair of speakers. A faux wood trimmed center horn section fronts the steering wheels which is wrapped in an aftermarket vinyl grip and textured and molded plastic creates the gauge housing and dashboard. This car has the Instrumentation Group option which replaces the clock with a tachometer and a trip odometer is added to the speedometer. A trio of gauges is in the center stack, also backed with faux woodtone applique, and containing the aftermarket AM/FM/Cassette radio. Vent and fan controls are below the radio and a clock heads up the center console where we find the floor mounted Hurst T-handle shifter and when not being shifted, an armrest is provided. Loop style black carpet covers the floor in good condition on the driver's side and shows some wear on the passenger's. The black cloth headliner and visors are also in good condition. Drivetrain Clean and driver quality under the long hood, we find the 351ci Cleveland V8 rated at 240 horsepower. It's tied to a Toploader 4-speed manual transmission and fueled with a 2-barrel carburetor. Power goes to the Ford 9 rear and power drum brakes are found front and rear. Undercarriage Surface rust coats most of the suspension components, the exhaust, and driveshaft. Oil is seen at the rear differential, the transmission and coated on the oil pan. One bit of flaky rust is seen on the belly pan and evidence of welding on a frame rail is observed. Overall, driver quality underneath with no major invasive rust other than the noted pan. The dual exhaust travels through glasspack style mufflers and out the back via chrome tips. Coil springs soften the independent suspension up front while leaf springs are found in the back. Drive-Ability This generation of Mach 1 always feels large, that tall fastback gives the car B-52 proportions but driving them and pointing that large hood towards our test loop is no problem at all. Aside from the obvious blind spot, visibility is good and dual sport mirrors were standard on the Mach 1. Decent power from the 351, and good handling due to stiffer coil springs that were provided on the Mach. On the downside, we find only that the horn does not work nor the turn signals. The Mach 1 is a legendary Mustang derivative and the 1971-1973 generation might be the most unique of all. That long sloping back, the hood scoops, and that distinctive tail make them desirable. We're not blowing smoke when we say we've found new owners for quite a few Mach 1's over the years and this is a great driver that will very likely find a new home.

Yes, this Camaro rides on an Art Morrison full chassis! As the original VIN number indicates this car was built in Los Angles, California as a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro Coupe with an 8-cylinder engine. WD-40 teamed up with SEMA Cares to build a very special 1967 Camaro which was also designed to pay tribute to both the SEMA Show and the Camaro's 50th Anniversary. This special 1967 Camaro was designed by Neil Tjin and built in partnership with Tjin and instructors from Universal Technical Institute. The installation of all its mechanical components was documented on PowerNation TV and was completed with help from a host of aftermarket companies including Eckler's, Budnik Wheels, Axalta, Eibach, Falken Tires, Baer Brake Systems, LR Auto Body and Optima Batteries. The car went on to debut at the SEMA Show where it was a big attraction. The car was sold a few months later and became part of a private collection. It was offered for sale with 975 test miles in August of 2024 and MS CLASSIC CARS jumped on the opportunity to purchase it. MS CLASSIC CARS gave this car a facelift during the service and detail process. December of 2024 is the first time it's been listed for sale since completion. The exterior of this Camaro is truly stunning with its factory body design, vibrant color and appointments. The straight body was outfitted with a cowl style hood, flush-mounted Kindig-It silver door handles and a carbon fiber rear spoiler. It was finished in a gorgeous dark shade of Yellow which dresses it perfectly. The high quality paint was recently detailed to a glossy shine. The yellow color is complemented with black trim including the glass moldings, windshield wipers, dual mirrors, grille, front bumper, front spoiler, rear tail panel, gas cap and rear bumper. It's equipped with all new tinted glass throughout, LED headlights and taillights. All of the exterior emblems were removed for a clean appearance.

The interior of this Camaro is the perfect blend of original and custom. It sports a custom leather headliner and inner sail panels. During the restoration it was treated with a complet new black interior with a yellow painted dash and yellow trimmed bucket seats. The dash pad, door panels, center console, door sills and carpeting is factory reproduction. Some of the custom features included aftermarket gauges, black tilt steering column, NRG Innovations steering wheel, Kenwood Excelon DMX 706S head unit and Lokar silver shifter.

The engine is cooled by a Mishimoto black aluminum radiator with dual electric fans and black aluminum overfill canister.

If you have been searching for a truly outstanding, investment quality, Classic Mustang Convertible that is extremely original and also is turn key ready to drive, show off, and enjoy than this one may be the one to end your search! with a production date of August 3, 1964 this is considered a 1964 1/2 early production Mustang. It is titled as a 1965 which is how all of the 64 1/2 card were titled. It was originally sold at Roy O'Brien Ford in St. Claire Shores, Michigan on August 17, 1964 and we have all the cool original documentation including the original window sticker, original sales order and agreement and original owners manual. I bought this car from a gentleman in Michigan who actually owned the car 2 different times and was the 3rd and 5th owner of the car. He originally purchased it in 2003 from the 2nd owner who was in Colorado where the car is believed to have spent most of its early life. He sold the car in 2011 to someone in Wyoming and told them if they ever decided to sell it to let him know. Well, 2 years later he got the call and bought it back from them in 2013 and owned it another 11 years before deciding that it was again time for it to be enjoyed by another lucky owner. I was thrilled to have the chance to buy it and was so impressed with the quality of this car when it arrived here in Alpharetta, GA and I just know this special Mustang Convertible is going to make the next owner extremely happy...maybe you?!! As you will see in the pics and video the body and paint look outstanding with no issues. It was believed to have been treated to a cosmetic restoration shortly before it was sold in 2003 and had one repaint in the correct, original Silversmoke Gray color which is a rare first year color. It looks silver in some lighting and has a silver blue tone at times as well. I have seen and owned quite a few early Mustangs and this car simply shouts quality and originality everywhere you look. The paint and body are close to show quality and I believe it still has all of its original body panels many with original stampings, which are extremely straight and body panels gaps are awesome. You might find a rock chip somewhere but the body is near flawless and this car will definitely win its share of trophies at the shows if that is what you enjoy. All of your chrome, stainless, emblems etc look fantastic. All of the glass, other than the windshield is original Carlite glass. I will provide a photo tour of the body panels and hopefully you will see just how nice this Pony is!!! Hopefully you will enjoy this Pony convertible with the top down but it does have a black power top that is also in fantastic condition. It goes up and down smoothly and latches down with ease and the windows all seal up nicely. It also has the black boot cover for when the top is down. Complimenting the Silversmoke Gray exterior is an extremely original black interior. Very possible that it is still all original and it is in awesome condition throughout. The only flaw I could see was a very small mark on the drivers seat that might have been from a cigarette. Dash pad looks great, carpeting all looks great, original style black rubber floor mats, gauges and bezel look great and everything appears to be working properly. An aftermarket hump hugger center console with cupholders was added but can easily be removed if desired. The original owners manual is still in the glove compartment. An aftermarket Kenwood stereo works well and the dash was not cut. Weatherstripping all looks excellent. You will be proud to show off this interior and find it very comfortable as well. This early production 64 1/2 has what we believe to be its original C-code 289 2bbl V-8. The date code on the block decodes as July 30, 1964 which falls just a few days prior to the cars build date. We believe the car has just a little over 125,000 miles on it and very possible it had a rebuild at some point prior to 2003 as it runs amazing and the internals are extremely clean. The gentleman we bought it from did have the original Autolite carburetor rebuilt last year. This car still has its original 3-speed manual transmission which shifts beautifully and is a lot of fun to drive. Manual steering and manual brakes but do not let that deter you. This lightweight Mustang steers very easily and tight and the brakes are dialed in and stop better than some power brake Mustangs I have owned. It has a very nice sounding dual exhaust. It is riding on a beautiful set of 14 Styled steel wheels and I put brand new BFG Radial TA tires on that have under 20 miles on them. As you will see we did a nice engine bay detail on this Pony classic so that she will shine and impress when you show her off. Inside the trunk is rock solid with matching spare. Undercarriage also looks great. Appears to have original floorpans with small patches done well on the front floorpans. I cannot emphasize enough just how nicely this car drives at any speed! This is one of those rare opportunities to buy a well documented, very original classic Mustang that was loved by its owners. Be sure to check out the video walk around and start up and all the pics to see just how nice this car is!!! Asking price is $49,500 and serious buyers can call me at with any questions. I am also a transport worker and can assist with getting you a great rate on Enclosed Transport anywhere in the country.

Acquired by the seller in 2019 and subsequently transformed into a high-performance showstopper, this Camaro is powered by a 6.2-liter Gen V LT1 V8 engine, paired with a cutting-edge 10-speed automatic transmission complete with paddle shifters for a dynamic driving experience. The addition of a Momo steering wheel enhances control and adds a modern touch to the retro-inspired cabin. Exterior Highlights Finished in a striking red with white rally-style stripes, this Camaro captures attention from every angle. The body, originally Azure Turquoise, was refinished during the refurbishment, and now boasts SS badging, LED lighting, chrome bumpers, dual side mirrors, and a cowl hood. Aerodynamics are accentuated with both front and rear spoilers. Enhancing its aesthetic and functionality, the car features matching CVF billet hood hinges, fender braces, trunk hinges, door jam vents, and door lock knobs. Performance and Handling The chassis is upgraded with a Detroit Speed front subframe and a four-link rear setup, anchored by coilover shocks and sway bars for exceptional handling. The Camaro sits on 18-inch Forgeline wheels with gray centers and polished lips, wrapped in BFGoodrich g-Force Rival tires. Stopping power is provided by Wilwood calipers gripping cross-drilled and slotted discs, ensuring reliable performance under all conditions. Interior Appointments Inside, the cabin blends vintage charm with modern convenience, featuring front Procar bucket seats trimmed in black vinyl and complemented by woodgrain accents on the center console. Modern amenities include Dakota Digital instrumentation, Vintage Air climate control, and a retro-look digital stereo. The horseshoe-style shifter and replacement carpets and rear bench upholstery refine the interior's aesthetic and comfort.

The engine's power is managed by a sophisticated transmission control unit tuned by LSXperts, ensuring optimal performance and drivability. The car's robust soundtrack is channeled through long-tube headers and a 3-inch stainless steel exhaust system with an H-pipe and Dynomax mufflers. Additional Features This Camaro is also equipped with a Detroit Speed rear axle and a limited-slip differential, enhancing its performance pedigree. The underbody is protected with Lizard Skin material for durability and sound dampening. A mere 1,200 miles show on the replacement odometer, indicating minimal use since the extensive modifications.

This is an absolutely beautiful 1971 Ford Bronco U14 Half Cab that received a beautiful restoration from a gentleman in Oregon who I have purchased several early Bronco Classics from over the years. He and his wife are true Bronco and Ford truck enthusiasts and he has been restoring them for many years He purchased this particular one in 1997 out of Dewey, Arizona where it lived a rust free life and was originally a forest service rig. He built this one for his wife to drive so they could go to the car shows and events together and this was her baby. Given that it was built for his wife, it had to be a reliable, nicely equipped, strong running, very comfortable rig that would turn heads everywhere. As you will see he knocked it out of the park and she loved this one and drove it for the past 26 years to the car shows and events or just out for a beautiful drive. The owners realized this Bronco was not being driven very much in the past few years and realized that it made sense to let it go to the next lucky owner, maybe you?! As you will see this is an absolutely beautiful Bronco that runs and drives as good as it looks. I will include lots of photos, an honest description and a video so you can see and hear how great she sounds. I am also a transport broker so I can assist in getting you a great rate on transport anywhere in the US. Paint and body look outstanding. This was an Arizona Bronco before going to Oregon and it lived a very rust free life. Body panels are extremely straight body panel fit is excellent. Doors open and shut very well. Hard to believe the restoration was almost 25 years ago as the paint and body still look amazing. Paint was a custom PPG Base coat/clear coat Ford Midnight Blue with just a little violet added Original frame was super solid and was sand blasted and painted. This was a high end professional paint job and the Bronco was always stored in a climate controlled garage and shows fantastic. Bumpers were replaced. New emblems and front grille painted silver with new FORD red letters. Billet Headlight Bezels with Hella Halogen lights. Special 50th anniversary badge added to grille. High performance Azurelite glass keeps out 93% of the direct heat. Half Cab hard top is in great condition and a brand new bikini top was added for when the roof is off. The truck bed was double lined with Linex and looks great. Custom roll bar from Tom\u2019s Bronco and a high lift jack is mounted to the roll bar. I noticed just a couple of small chips that have been touched up. Overall, the paint and body are definitely worthy of showing this Bronco off at local shows and events and will likely win its share of trophies if that is what you enjoy. It did win trophies for the previous owners. As you will see in the pics it is a beautiful Bronco, sounds great and runs and drives beautifully. The interior was nicely upgraded with a split bench seat from a 2000 Ford Ranger that was custom upholstered in more of an original Bronco pattern. Super comfortable high back seats and the fold down center console gives you a nice armrest or fold it up and put your kid between you like the good ol\u2019 days. This set up is way more comfortable than stock seats but still maintains an original color and pattern which looks great. Since it is an original half cab it does not have a rear seat but one could be added if desired. New door panels and new carpeting with nice set of Ford floor mats added. Nice sounding Kenwood stereo. Great Dakota digital gauge cluster that fits in stock location but provides much more info. Rich looking custom teak Grant steering wheel with a tilt steering column. And for those of you living in the hot climates this baby has Ice cold Vintage Air Conditioning as well! As you will see, the interior is also show worthy and looks amazing.

Freshly built MQ-code L78 396/375 horsepower with 4-speed. Beautiful and unusual Sequoia Green paint. Detailed undercarriage, new interior. Nicely documented. A cool big block Camaro with a lot of power behind it.Some of our favorite cars are those that combine a subtle look with big firepower under the hood, and this pretty 1968 Chevrolet Camaro SS396 is no exception. In photos, the paint looks charcoal gray, but there's definitely a hint of green to it?hence the name 'Sequoia Green.' It's unusual but correct as code V is this car's original color. Underneath, there's some very straight bodywork that shows rather well, and as an early production '68, it has the nose stripe that blends into the side spear for a unique look that'll definitely stand out. Panel gaps are quite good all around and we're happy to see that the car wears an original-style hood with the simulated chrome velocity stacks?still one of the cooler designs of the era. We believe the quarters have been replaced but the work was expertly done and the car fits together beautifully with no signs of hack work or amateur patching. Correct badges were fitted wherever they were needed, and we love the industrial look of a Camaro without the ubiquitous ducktail spoiler. This one just looks mean and purposeful. And as a bonus, all the lighting is LED?nice!Inside, most of the interior furnishings are new, including the seat covers, carpets, and door panels. There's a woodgrained steering wheel that warms up the otherwise all-black driver's compartment, and enthusiasts will be pleased to see options like a tilt steering column, a factory tick-tock-tach, and auxiliary gauges down on the center console. There's also a Hurst shifter with cue ball knob for the Muncie 4-speed underneath, and it racks through the gears like a bolt-action rifle. There's also a fresh A/C and heater system from Vintage Air that uses R134a refrigerant for easy maintenance in the future (note that the original heater components are included). There's also a digital AM/FM stereo with speakers in the custom kick panels that provide a neatly integrated look. The car is equipped with unusual factory shoulder belts, which were a rare option in 1968, and it appears that most of the weather seals were replaced during the build so it seals up well. In back there's a super clean trunk with correct spatter paint and a new mat to make it look tidy.The engine is a correct MQ-coded 396 cubic inch V8, and the MQ suffix code decodes to a 1968 L78 with 375 horsepower and a 4-speed manual transmission. With a fresh rebuild by the experts at Mongoose Motorsports (receipts accompany the car), it probably grunts out at least that much today. A few modifications help, including an Edelbrock aluminum intake manifold, a set of beautiful long-tube headers, and a big 4-barrel carburetor on top. It wears correct Chevy Orange paint and proper 375 horsepower decals so it looks the part of a Camaro powerplant. Other upgrades include a dual power master cylinder for the front disc brakes, a large aluminum radiator, a polished A/C compressor, and a new alternator. Underneath, it's quite clean with super solid floors, subframe connectors, and all-new lines for fuel and brakes. The Muncie 4-speed feeds a 12-bolt rear end with what we believe are 3.42 gears inside, which are a nice combination of acceleration and easy cruising on the highway. You'll also find new shocks, a fresh gas tank out back, and a rumbling dual exhaust system with stainless Magnaflow mufflers. And it gets just the right industrial look from 15-inch steel wheels painted body color and outfitted with dog dish hubcaps and 225/70/15 BFGoodrich T/A radials.Documentation includes extensive receipts for the recent work, including the engine rebuild, as well as photos and details from previous owners. We haven't seen many early Camaros that combine great looks, lots of comfort and convenience features, and a bulletproof big block powertrain. The awesome color combination is insanely appealing and it more than lives up to the billing with the built 396 under the hood. A Camaro that's a whole lot of fun to drive and show, ready to rock.

It is in top condition with less than 14,000 miles, driven only during spring/summer months. The original car belonged to my father in-law and was powered by a 289ci V8 with a three-speed automatic transmission. Upon his passing, I undertook a 2-year project to restore and modify the car to make it car-show ready. The body was taken down to its bare bones through thermal and blast stripping by Aesthetic Finishers (afpower.com) and then rebuilt and painted by Greg Huber from Kaotic Kustoms. A new (2013) crate Ford Boss 302 engine (444 HP at the crank) was installed and customized by Paul Faessler and his team from Paul\u2019s Automotive Engineering, together with a new 6 speed automatic transmission, ECU, reinforced suspension, power assisted front disc and rear drum brakes, C&R Coyote radiator with fans and trans cooler, etc. All the interior has been re-done with new upholstery using the original seats frame and door panels. All instrumentation is new, using Dakota Digital instruments but with the 1968 Mustang look. American Racing 16\u201d wheels with Michelin tires completed the package. This was a single-family owned car that, unfortunately, I need to part ways with, as I am in the process of moving from Ohio to Florida and downsizing from a house to an apartment with no space to keep the car. All in, I have spent north of $100K on the car and my asking price is $60,000. Hope to find a good home that loves and enjoys this car as much as I have.

They featured a hot solid lifter cam, 11.5 1 compression, big square port heads with up sized valves, an aluminum high rise intake with a 780 Holley feeding it fuel. This is a period correct and 375 hp coded motor. It is restored like factory new. It has the correct chrome open element air cleaner and chrome valve covers. It also has factory deep groove pulleys because you don't want the belts flying off at high RPMs. Correct battery spring clamp cables. Cadmium plated power brake booster. The distributor, fuel pump, clutch fan, shroud all have a stock appearance. All the components are proper and clean. The metal surfaces are painted smooth. The wiring harness is replaced. TRUNK COMPARTMENT Under the trunk lid and the jamb is painted smooth and glossy. Inside is perfectly clean metal. I don't see any splices or patches. It has been correctly spatter painted with a spray gun. The weather strip and tail light housings look new. UNDERSIDE Its original California metal appears to be clean and dry, no rust or patches. The front end steering and suspension has been rebuilt. In back it has the correct mono leaf springs and a square traction bar that's unique to the big blocks. Correct dual exhaust system with a transverse muffler. The fuel system has been replaced including the tank, straps and sending unit. It has disc brakes in front, drums in back. E-brake assembly is hooked up. Looking up at the motor it is clean Chevy Orange, the starter looks fresh. It has the correct canister type oil filter. It has a correct 1967 Muncie 4-speed trans and a 12 bolt rear end. SERVICE We inspected the car and replaced the reverse light switch, replaced the throw out bearing, installed a new speedometer cable and gave it a wheel alignment. CONCLUSION This is a rare, investment grade car. They only made 602 Z28s in 1967 and I found dozens that sold at auction. I couldn't find 1 L78!

The Yenko Camaro was originally a high-performance, modified version of the Chevrolet Camaro, built in partnership with Don Yenko, a dealer known for customizing cars for street and racing use. Here's what you might expect in a 1969 Yenko Camaro LSA 6.2-liter supercharged re-creation 1. Engine \u2022 LSA 6.2L Supercharged V8 The centerpiece of the recreation is the modern LSA engine, which is a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 engine derived from GM's performance line of engines. It's part of the LS family of engines that have earned a legendary status among performance enthusiasts. \u2022 Power Output The LSA engine produces around 580 horsepower and 551 lb-ft of torque, offering a significant upgrade in terms of power over the original Yenko Camaro's 427 V8 engine. \u2022 Supercharger The Eaton supercharger on the LSA engine boosts power output and provides excellent throttle response, making the car a much faster, more responsive machine compared to its vintage counterpart. 2. Transmission \u2022 Modern Transmission The original 1969 Yenko Camaro would have come with a Muncie 4-speed manual or automatic transmission, but in the LSA recreation, it is mated to a 4L80E automatic, ensuring smooth power delivery and improved performance. 4. Exterior and Design \u2022 Classic 1969 Camaro Styling The re-creation keeps the classic 1969 Camaro body, maintaining the aggressive styling that made the original Yenko Camaro famous. Expect a combination of muscle car aesthetics with a few modern touches. \u2022 Yenko Branding The car would include Yenko badges, hood stripes, and other period-correct decals to evoke the spirit of the original Yenko Camaro. \u2022 Wheels and Tires Upgraded, modern wheels that can handle high-performance driving, often featuring larger diameters with tires suited for better grip and handling. 5. Technology & Features \u2022 Modern Electronics While the classic Yenko Camaro had basic electronics, the LSA re-creation has updated tech, including better lighting, modern digital displays. \u2022 Exhaust System Custom exhaust system designed to give the car an aggressive muscle car growl while enhancing performance. Conclusion A 1969 Yenko Camaro LSA 6.2-liter supercharged re-creation brings the best of both worlds-classic muscle car styling combined with modern performance and technology. While the original Yenko Camaro was already a performance powerhouse, this recreation takes it to the next level with the LSA supercharged engine, ensuring a thrilling driving experience while retaining the unmistakable retro muscle car appeal. This is a stunning example of a Restomod 1969 Chevrolet Yenko Camaro powered by a ground pounding LSA 6.2 Liter Supercharged Engine! This Camaro is pushing 600HP and is mated to a four speed automatic transmission. There is power steering, Power Disc brakes, Tilt Wheel, Digital Gauges, Air conditioning, Custom Wheels, Custom Tires, Spare Tire. The paint has a deep shine and a mirror like finish and all of the chrome, trim and bright work glisten in the sun.

Built as a tribute to a Shelby GT350 convertible, this bad boy is more than just eye candy. According to the build specs, its 302 CID V8 features a 1968 C80E iron block (C80E-6015A), which has been treated to a circa 1987-92 Fox Body Mustang's 5.0L configuration. It features a 5.0 HO aluminum intake, complete with plenum spacer and Cobra upper intake, 70MM MAF calibrated for its 24LB/HR injectors, BBK adjustable fuel pressure regulator, Hedman shorty headers, MSD coil, A9P ECM, K&N filter on its CAI, and a Vortech V-3 supercharger. An external in-line 43GPH fuel pump supplies the fuel. The supercharged 302 is kept cool by a big aluminum radiator, which is equipped with an electric fan (in addition to the belt driven fan). Backing the 302 is a crisp shifting T5 5-speed manual transmission. Based on the information we have, it appears the build was completed in 2020, because it's sporting a new clutch (installed in 2020) and the front end was aligned in 2020 as well. There are a little over 1000 miles on this car since it received its restomod treatment, according to the documentation we were supplied. It also has a custom dual exhaust system with Flowmaster Outlaw mufflers, which has a nice muscle car sound to it. It's riding on fresh radial tires (which also show 2020 DOT codes on them) that wrap 17-inch Shelby style aluminum wheels, and the rear suspension has coilover shocks. Inside, you'll find white-faced gauges, with Autometer tach and coolant temp gauges in the console, as well as the boost and fuel pressure gauges under the dash. Its black ComfortWeave synthetic leather seats are in very good shape, showing little wear (if any), and the black carpet looks nearly new. The woodgrain-trimmed console, dash, and door elements add a classy touch, and the AM/FM/Cassette head unit is styled to look like OEM (but it's not). The front kick panels house 5-inch Pioneer speakers. Additional features on this slick 1967 Shelby GT350 (tribute) convertible include Air Conditioning (needs a charge), Automatic Convertible Top (which is in like new condition), Power Brakes, Power Steering, and Seat Belts. If you're looking for a Shelby, but you want something you can drive on a regular basis, this fuel-injected, supercharged '67 Mustang is ready to fit right into your garage.

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1969 Chevrolet Camaro\nWhen it comes to modifying your classic muscle car, there can be tons of trial and error involved to get just the right engine matched up with just the right cam and just the right gearing, along with hundreds of other interrelated small but crucially important decisions. If any combination of those decisions doesn't line up, it can turn your fun-loving hobby into a money-pit nightmare of wasted time and effort. That is why when a car like this 1969 Chevrolet Camaro SS Tribute 632 Restomod comes along, it is an opportunity that should not be passed up. Look beyond the relatively subtle fully repainted Hugger Orange and twin full-length black racing stripes, and you'll find an unbelievably powerful street car ready to dominate drag strips and car shows. Inside this beast, we find a stock-appearing black vinyl interior that features a complete AutoMeter gauge setup that includes a four-pod cluster seated at the head of the center console. An aftermarket three-spoke padded steering wheel, while new wiring throughout the interior which allows the upgraded AM/FM/Aux RetroRadio to complement your mood with the perfect soundtrack. Under that cowl sits a behemoth BluePrint Engines 632 cubic-inch V-8 engine that begins with light aluminum heads and a matching aluminum intake manifold. Feeding that intake is a FiTech EFI system rated for 800 horsepower. An in-tank electric fuel pump, MSD full ignition/distributor, work harmoniously with a March Pulley system to create a symphony of power that has made a dyno-proven 805 horsepower and 859 pound-feet of torque at the rear wheels. Keeping that big V-8 cool is a Griffin radiator supported by a dual-electric fan setup. That massive power is funneled through a Tremec TKO600 Tranzilla five-speed manual outfitted with a McLeod Racing Street Twin clutch setup before being sent out to a built 12-bolt Positraction rear end that uses Strange axles and 4.10 gears to launch this Camaro hard enough to keep you grinning for days. This 1969 Chevrolet Camaro SS Tribute 632 Restomod rides on an adjustable front suspension featuring QA1 coilovers with adjustable shocks at the rear. Subframe connectors keep this car's crazy torque from twisting itself into a pretzel, while a trick set of 18-inch U.S. Mags wheels shod in staggered 225/40ZR-18 front and bigger 275/ZR-18 rear G-Max rubber puts as much of that power to the tarmac as physics will allow. *632 CID V8 *805 Dynoed HP *859 Dynoed LB-FT *Aluminum Heads *Aluminum Intake *MSD Ignition *FiTech EFI *March Pullies *Griffin Aluminum Radiator *Dual Electric Fans *Five Speed Manual *Tremec TKO600 Tranzilla *4.10 Rear *Strange Axles *Four Wheel Power Discs *Wilwood Brakes *QA1 Front Coilovers *Subframe Connectors *18 Inch US Mags There is so much more to this car that can only be appreciated in person.

As a consumer, it's important to understand the basics of restoration levels for it can impact classic car values substantially. There are hundreds of ways to restore a vintage car or truck including but not limited to the following i). Frame off restoration.

You find the original front end pieces including clean wrap around shock towers as well as the larger sway bar. The original 9 inch housing and staggered shock plates are intact with the upper rear brace in great condition to. Unfortunately the rear center section was traded out many rears ago at which time the 31 spline axles also dissapeared and a 28 spline 3.00 we believe was installed and is connected to an original 9 inch driveshaft. As for the body the worst first, the cowl is bad and that killed the driver floor and lower supports as well. Sorry to say the passenger side is also compromised. An attempt to fill the area where rotted panels were removed the floor panels are lightly installed although we feel the patch panels should be removed and replace them with a 1 piece floor pan. Now the better body panel news, the original rolled lip fenders are clean and in good shape. The quarter panels and trunk area have very little rot with the roof panel also in good condition. The hood and doors will probably need replacing as well as front and rear valences and the trunk lid is a 69 so it will neep replacing. The trunk floor is OK so thats a plus .

Loaded with features that make it an awesome driver. Get noticed anywhere you go! What is a California Special? It was a limited production Mustang only sold for one year and only in California. They all started as a GT and then were trimmed out with many several Shelby features. Many novices would see it and think it was a Shelby prototype coupe!

When Car & Driver Magazine tested a small block one in May of 1971 they stated, \ufffd\u20ac\ufffdIt's a Camaro like none before.\ufffd\u20ac\ufffd It was longer, lower, and wider than the first generation Camaro. GM engineers have said the second generation is much more of 'A Driver's Car' than its predecessor. The 1972 Chevrolet Camaro SS 350 we have in stock at Skyway Classics is a bright white one with a black vinyl top, black stripe, rear spoiler, small block Chevrolet engine, and equipped with the split bumper Rally Sport front end that has become such a classic.

The Mustang has been a phenomenon since its introduction in 1964. Considered Fords longest running production car as the nameplate is still used today. With over one million units sold in the first two years the Mustang is truly an American success story. Leading competitors were quick to get into the pony car craze including the Chevrolet Camaro, Pontiac Firebird and AMC Javelin.This one-owner 1964 1/2 Ford Mustang is painted in Guardsman Blue. A set of chrome factory rally wheels, whitewall tires, chrome bumpers/ trim, and dual mirrors are great exterior features.

How many Trans Ams sold after Smokey and the Bandit became a hit? What did Back to the Future do for DeLoreans? What body style is the most famous Mustang and the most valuable movie car in history? Steve McQueen's fastback Mustang, of course. Fastbacks were always seen as the more youthful, sporty version of the Mustang and 4 out of 5 car guys agree, they're just plain cool, (not a scientific sampling). For consignment, a 1965 Ford Mustang Fastback. It's original looking and wears a beautiful hue of blue. The car has been garaged by our consignor who is also not afraid to drive it distances. This car made the trip to Ocean City, Maryland, a three hour trip, and to Classic Auto Mall, an hour away without incident. Exterior Two stage Silver Blue paint adorns the car and helps make the iconic lines of the car pop. From the recessed waistline cove to the louvered rear quarters, everything is just a bit crisper in this color. The beautiful chrome bumpers, Mustang emblazoned grille, and headlights meld seamlessly with the silver tones in the paint, while the taillights and front marker lights explode with contrast. Other metal work including the window frames, door handles, and side mirrors are in fine condition. 14-inch steel styled wheels look great, and the blue Mustang center cap is a great accent. Imperfections in the paint include bubbling down low, a touched up S-shaped scratch, also low, some extra paint drip, a gap in the headlight surround, evidence of body filler sculpting, and general panel gap imperfections. Interior Black vinyl door panels with stitched pattern inserts look fantastic and clean. The same can be said about the low back bucket front seats, and their silver side molding shining bright. The 2+2 seats in the back are purposely shaped to allow the back to fold down providing a carpet topped cargo area that is voluminous. A wood rimmed steering shines with a lacquered surface and is complemented by its polished metal spokes. Sliding down the column we find Rally Pac gauges, an optional accessory in 1965 which includes a clock on one side and tachometer on the other. Above it the standard horizontal speedometer is flanked by two round gauges in splendid symmetrical synergy. The AM/FM radio is embedded in the dash to the right, above a bank of chrome vents. Ford's T-handle shifter is floor mounted, surrounded by faded loop style carpet that retains its black color in the footwells. A center armrest has been added and has the ever important cup holders. The trunk is unlined and clean. Drivetrain Under the hood, we find a rebuilt 302ci V8 topped by an Edelbrock 4-barrel carburetor and intake manifold. The presentation is driver quality dressed with chrome valve covers and air filter element cover. It is connected to a rebuilt C4 3-speed automatic transmission sending power back to the Ford 8 rear with 3.00 conventional gears. Drum brakes are situated at each wheel. Undercarriage Driver quality underneath as well with plenty of surface rust and more concerning rust on frame rails and patterns, along with patched panels on the rear torque boxes, areas of flaking rust, and separation. There's a bit of surface rust on the door bottoms as well. The dual exhaust looks great however and flows from headers back to stainless steel muffler and then out the back via downturned tailpipes. We also note no leaks or misplaced fluid. Coil springs are on the front independent suspension while leaf springs are in the back. Drive-Ability The sloping rear window provides great visibility, and we'll gladly sacrifice the blind spot for the iconic louvered panel. The big steering wheel provides a great handle and off we trot onto the test loop with the 302 breathing well through headers and dual exhaust, and it sounds darn good too!

First Gen Camaro lovers get a cup of coffee and sit down because we need to talk. The phrase, Barn Find, may be the most over used automotive description of all time. However, this amazing collectible Camaro has been owned by the consignors family for over fifty years and was just pulled out of the garage for the first time in quite a while. The original NM L48 350/295hp (V-Flint, MS- manual) (3914678 casting#) engine rests under the iconic Ice tray hood. In addition, the owner states the powerful mill has never been out of the car. This is a factory four speed SS mated to its original 12-bolt rear differential. Camaro enthusiasts will quickly notice the D80 spoiler which debuted in 1968 and became widely popular. This Camaro will generate massive interest and numerous inquires so please pay attention. The frame rails, floor pans, and trunk appear to be very solid. The original trunk mating and spare tire can still be found resting in their proper position. The owner states this First Gen was never wrecked and repainted only once. It's so original it's mind boggling. Does it need some work? Yes. The front suspension bushings are showing their age for sure and there are some fluid leaks as expected. Before you ask, unfortunately, we do not have the build sheet. Please do not call or email us simply to pick the car apart. This is a rare survivor that will need some attention but you'll be hard pressed to find another two owner, First Gen, vinyl top, four-speed, SS Camaro that's still wearing its original metal. Expect this one to create a feeding frenzy.

By 1970, the Camaro had already established itself as an icon of American muscle cars. The 1970 model year marked the second generation of the Camaro, known as the split-bumper model due to its distinctive front-end design featuring two separate bumper sections. This generation offered a wide range of engine options, from the base inline-six to potent V8s, catering to various performance preferences. The top-tier engine was the legendary 396 cubic-inch V8, known as the SS 396, which produced up to 375 horsepower. Alongside its impressive power, the 1970 Camaro boasted refined styling and handling improvements compared to its predecessor, cementing its status as a favorite among enthusiasts. The 1970 Camaro also saw updates in interior comfort and technology, reflecting the era's growing emphasis on driver experience. With its combination of powerful engines, sleek design, and improved features, the 1970 Chevrolet Camaro remains a highly sought-after classic car, symbolizing the peak of American muscle car culture during that period.

Also available additional purchase are new and used trim parts to accent, even complete this rare piece. This recently acquired 289 high performance GT fastback began as a young man's project back in early 2000. After saving his pay checks he had a local body shop addressed a multitude of sheet metal work. From there it began to sit in despair for 20+years collecting dust and whatever else mother nature could throw at it under a carport. Last fall great things happened with his dream as he traded it in on another running 66 Mustang fastback we had at a swap meet. After adding quite a few suspension parts we began assembling this shell of a vehicle and once it was put together as you see it. To preserve it we added a primer sealer to bring it all together as we offer it to the market as a good driver quality project. We started this project by removing some damaged panels and replacing parts as well as adding pieces as needed. With this rare car, we were able to complete the original look and fit by using a mix of new items like fenders, trunk lid, rear window upper panel, both valances are some of the aftermarket parts that are installed. The good news is we have in hand a clear Florida title and the complete front clip has all original stamped panels as well as the buck or build tag. Being a real fastback the roof assembly the hood, driver's door and many of the Ford installed structural panels even the cowl are all Genuine FORD parts too. During the build the owner added a 1 piece aftermarket floor, rear seat pan, trunk pans and the tail light panel. All the panels while in place need finishing touches and sealing to move forward with a build. I am letting someone build it to their standard driver or show its up to you. Many more metal pieces like toe pans fire wall and even shock towers were replaced and need finishing to be bring this back Category 1966_ford_mustang"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Price is $23995.00"}]}

It has probably been driven less than 30 miles in the last 25 years. The trim tag is missing but the VIN shows it as a 68 charger R/T with a 440 375 hp engine. All the body panels are original except the quarter panels and they were replaced with panels from Year One. The floor pans and trunk are in good shape there is a couple of small spots that looked to have been patched many years ago. I am a friend of the family and am posting this for them I can send as many pictures as you want of this car. I will be glad to get it up in the air and take pictures of the undercarriage as well. Again this is not a show car it does need to be finished with some work it would be a solid driver but if your looking for a Mecum car or perfection this is not for you.

Not one but two new Broncos will debut this year, following up on a legacy that stretched from 1966 until 1996, when the last big Bronco rolled off the assembly line. In its 30 years, Dearborn's rugged 4x4 changed with the times, laying the foundation for the SUVs that took over the range in the 1990s. Also, fun fact The carburetor of the Bronco featured special floats to battle fuel flooding or starvation during off-roading in steep terrain. A number of other systems were beefed up to make it able to handle itself off-road, including a larger oil pan and a more capable fuel pump. For consignment, a generation 1 version right out of 1972 as a 3 owner rig with 53,010 title verified miles. This vehicle lives up to its name as it is unbroken on the acceleration front, and a full press of the accelerator and it is off like its namesake, we give you the 1972 Bucking Bronco. Redone in 1988 and given a new fiberglass body and including a pickup truck body should you want to change things up a bit, all looking sweet in its off roading ready black hue, nifty wheels, lift kit, and all maintenance attended to as needed. Saddle up! Exterior Step right up and shake hands with the paint which is a beautiful and menacing black hue, this off road dweller is looking just pretty nice with well minded gaps throughout but does have chip off revealing turquoise underneath along with dry spots in the finish and some inclusions in various areas. In nice contrast the chrome trimming on the black painted grille with its simple round projector headlights on either side and a thin but effective shiny chrome bumper below. All panels are straight including the hood with its custom integrated functional hood scoop and Mack bulldog. Our example comes complete with a removable black canvas top for all your open air adventures and presents in clean condition with no tears. With a windscreen that can tilt forward for unlimited views, and a roll bar just in case an errant wave puts you wheels up, you will be protected. Tinted glass all around on the soft top and a tailgate that has a small storage area upon opening it along with a rear seat. Another nicely trimmed thin bumper below and dual exhaust pipes which are peeking out the bottom with angle cut tips, it's ready for the race. 15-inch highly polished chrome wheels wrapped in 31x10.50R15LT rubber on all 4 corners will get you through the wettest sand the coast has to offer. Interior Keep it simple would sum it up for this wild ride as we saddle up and climb aboard. We perch on new black vinyl buckets passing black door panels on our way inside. Up front is an original dash with just the facts ma'am, on the instrument front, a single circular gauge cluster for this fine equine along with the addition some wood applique give the dash an air of class. Installed within the dash is an AM/FM/Cassette stereo and a few added emblems for good looks. The dash front is topped by a near perfect black padded vinyl topper and fronted by a 3 spoke Grant GT steering wheel. Your 4-wheel shifter and transmission shifter, both courtesy of Duffy's, is on the center on the floor. Near perfect black rubber carpeting floods the floors in the front and rear. A black vinyl bench in the rear provides room for 2 more and there's room in the way back for your beach blanket, grill and cooler. The surrounding paint and interior surfaces are all in nice condition. Drivetrain They say never look a gift horse in the mouth, however we here at Classic Auto Mall with our inquiring minds pay no attention to this theory so we pop the hood and are met with a pleasant surprise! 302 cubes, original and unmolested, all bathed in patined Ford blue rests in the unrestored bay. Chrome valve covers offset all the patinafinish and air cleaner assembly hides the 2-barrel carburetor unit underneath. This mill is aligned with the 3-speed manual transmission that sends power to a 9 Ford rear axle and if you happen to get mired down in the surf a Dana 44 axle is on the front to get you back on your way. A shout out to thered ignitionwiring and hose covers throughout the bay. Undercarriage Up on our lift we can inspect the belly of this beast and we note solid full frame construction, light rust, and all looking simple and good to go. Trailing arm and coil springs for the front suspension, and leaf springs for the rear combined with a 2-inch suspension lift kit help you traverse and dunes you may come across with new shocks and bushings installed. 4 wheel drum brakes along with power steering and a dual FlowMaster exhaust to produce a robust engine sound as you take her roaring down the beach. Drive-Ability The black called me and I had to take it for a ride. It did not disappoint and was the most fun I've had driving the many cars in our inventory here in a while. An awesome kick is had with a press of the accelerator, plenty of straight bias free whoa on the solid braking, and solid handling was exhibited. Unfortunately, our test track hasn't been upgraded with 4x4 accommodations just yet, so I'll save the off-roading for you. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. Plenty of thoroughbred power, the sure footedness of a mountain goat, and looks to attract attention like a Clydesdale, this fine example of the Ford Bronco from 1972 is just a load of fun to drive and looks great while doing it.

Ford made Mustang more enticing by offering special Mustang models throughout the year.Midway through the 1966 model year, the limited-edition Sprint 200 package began to be promoted due to the overwhelming demand for the 289 c.i.d. V-8, which Ford was running short of. What Ford was not running short of however was the 200 c.i.d. six cylinder; a direct result of the dismal sales of the newly-redesigned Falcon for 1966 (which also used this inline six as its standard engine). In order to give the six cylinder a nice sales boost, Ford offered a special Sprint 200 option package.The Mustang Sprint 200 was a Ford promotion that would avoid a production slowdown in which the readily-available 200 six would be dressed up with a chrome air cleaner with a special decal and a chrome oil-filler cap. Two transmission packages were offered; 'A' signified the car having a manual transmission, while 'B' cars had automatics.Known as the The Sprint 200, the package was offered mid 1966 and was marketed as a sporty package specifically designed for the base 200 cubic inch 6 cylinder engine. Sprint options included center floor console; painted side accent stripes (color matched with the car's interior); deletion of the chrome rear quarter ornaments; a set of deluxe 48 spoke, blue center wire-style wheel covers; and a 'Sprint 200' decal on the engine's chrome air cleaner cover.It is estimated that of the total number of Sprint 200 Mustangs built in the 1966 model year that 75% of them were package 'B' automatics. Further enhancements would be made both in the interior as well as the exterior with the interior center console with courtesy lights, side accent paint stripe (color matched with the car's interior), and the deluxe wire-style wheel covers.The Sprint name was rarely used in Ford advertising; the package was sold mostly under the guise of three distinct promotions, offered only as 'Limited Edition' Mustangs. A number of convertibles and fastbacks were offered under these promotions as well, but it seems as though their availability was never advertised. While most Mustangs with the Sprint 200 label were primarily sold in the early months of 1966, some were built as early as November 1965 and some as late as August of 1966. An estimated 20,000 were produced in 1966 yet only about 400 are in the active registry and known to still be in existence and on the road today.This is one of the few Limited Edition 1966 Mustang Sprint 200's left in existence and on the road. With only 89k original miles, it was originally produced on April 26, 1966 at the Metuchen Ford Plant. This Mustang has the Sprint 'b' package with indicates it has the C-4 Cruise-a Matic automatic transmission. It has under gone an extensive rotisserie restoration. Repainted in the original Wimbledon white with red interior & trim. Original door data tag still riveted to the door sill. Original engine tag still affixed to engine block. Original glove box tag, & Owner's Manual. Scoot Martin Data Plate Decoder shows everything is correct. Category 1966_ford_mustang"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Price is $23995.00"}]}

The massive success that was Fords Mustang did not go unnoticed by the folks over at Chevrolet. Looking to capture a share of the burgeoning pony car market, Chevrolets answer to the Mustang was the Camaro. Making its debut in September of 1966 the Camaro, like the Mustang, was available in a wide array of options and body styles. Introduced two years after the Mustang, Chevrolet realized that to pose a serious threat, merely introducing the Camaro would not be enough - a car capable of beating the Mustang at the racetrack was needed if the Camaro was to stand a chance against the widely popular Mustang and thus the Z28 was born.This is one very fine daily driving example of an increasingly collectible and desirable 1968 Chevrolet Camaro Convertible in unabused and mostly all original and stock good condition; these are very rare American classic cars and will always be internationally respected and desired by any classic American classic car or Camaro enthusiast!

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1969 Chevrolet Camaro\n1969 SS 350 CAMARO RESTO-MOD The vin and trim tags verify this car was built in the first week of October 1969. The build plant was in Norwood, Ohio. It came with the 350 motor and automatic transmission. It is an X-44 model NON-SS Sport Coupe. The Daytona yellow body color, black vinyl top, and black with yellow deluxe interior are authentic to the original build. I, the owner purchased the camaro from its 2nd owner in August of 2004. The 2nd owner had the car since 1969 and bought it from Mohawk Chevy in Schenectady, NY. The 2nd owner related to me the current owner that the 1st owner had purchased it at Mohawk and soon realized it wasn't suiting his needs in 69. He traded it back to them for a larger sedan. I, the current owner drove the car for approximately 3 years the way I purchased it from the 2nd owner. After that decidedto restore the car to better than new condition and upgrade it to an SS model. I went into the full restore with the mine set of I could have ordered this car with all these options in 69 . Between 2007 and 2010 I did a frame off restoration. I have photos documentation and receipts to back up the full build. The camaro has matching number original drive train. The motor was refreshed completely top to bottom to \u201cSS\u201d power and operating specs. The distributor was changed to an electronic system for reliability. The intake manifold was replaced with an Edelbrock aluminum 4-bbl style and a new 600 CFM carburetor performance series. A K&N open air element breather sits on top. The valve covers were replaced with a set of aluminum black grooved covers to match the breather on top the carburetor. The fuel tank, fuel pump, all fuel lines, and fuel gauge sending unit were replaced. The M-38 3speed automatic transmission was rebuilt to factory specs. The rear axle is a non-positraction 10 bolt with all new fluids, seals, bearings, and gears (308). Drive shaft U-joints were replaced with shaft. The brakes were originally 14\u201d 4 wheel drums on steel wheels. I upgraded to 15\u201d magnum 500 wheels (which were an option in 1969) and a front disk brakes with slotted drilled rotors kit from CCP. The master cylinder and booster assembly was also replaced at the same time as the CCP kit install. The rear brakes are still drums, but completely gone through and replaced/built to factory specs. In February of 2024 I installed another new booster and master cylinder. The cooling system has a new radiator, thermostat, water pump, fan clutch, and heater core installed. Belts and hose have all been replaced. The air conditioning is factory original, but I installed all new hoses and related components. Compressor was rebuilt and converted to R-134. The system was just serviced recently and given a clean bill of health with no leaks and blowing cold. The power steering is factory original. The belts, hoses, and all related components were replaced. The front suspension was completely gone through and replaced with new parts. The rear suspension was also replaced with new parts at the same time. The dual exhaust system was custom built from the factory exhaust manifolds back, including a \u201cX\u201d pipe and flow master \u201c50\u201d series mufflers. In June/July of 2023 the camaro was fully serviced including oil, filter, fluids checked, and tires were replaced with GOODRICH TA Radials 215/70/15 raised white letters (DOT-CODE 05-23). The camaro has had less than 500 miles put on it since then. In February of 2024 the battery was replaced with a 12V DIE HARD Battery. The vehicle spent several years in upstate New York before I acquired it from the 2nd owner. Therefore it had rust in all the usual places common on these year camaros. I elected during the full restoration to not repair the rust, but rather replace with new sheet metal reproduction panels. To this end, virtually all body panels are new and rust free. The only original sheet metal on the camaro is the floor pans and the roof. The pans at the time of restoration were good. I applied gator guard undercoating to them for added rust prevention and sound deadening. The entire under area was also gator guarded prior to installing the drive train. The roof had only minor surface rust that was repaired before it was primed, painted, and the new vinyl top was installed. The windshield and rear glass were both replaced. The side glass is all original. The body was painted Daytona Yellow per trim code. The paint was PPG band base-coat clear-coat. All exterior marking lights, trim pieces, spoilers, grill, decals, and \u201cSS\u201d emblems are new. They were all replaced after painting was completed. No exterior antennae was installed, there is a hidden one in the trunk. The interior on the camaro was completely replaced to factory specs. The only original pieces retained were the seat frames, the console, the am-fm radio, the metal dash, and the headliner. Dynamat sound deadening material was installed under the carpet. The seats were completely rebuilt and recovered with OEM correct material. The console was rebuilt and I added the four gauge instrument cluster that was optional in 69. The original speedometer read 99,244 Miles when I started the full restoration. It broke while turning 100,000 miles and I replaced it whith one for an \u201cSS\u201d model. It currently reads less than 2,000 miles. That is the miles put on the car since finishing the full restoration in 2010. I added the tach and clock at the same time which were all options in 69. This 1969 SS Chevy Camaro Resto-Mod is for all practical purposes a new 69 Camaro. Due to failing health, It is very difficult for me to get in and out of the car. It is still great fun for me to drive and I love it. The above work has all been document in photos and receipts which I have all of, these things will go with the car. The Camaro really does shut, gap, and drive better than a new one you could have bought in 69. It's time to let someone else enjoy the car!

Aftermarket center console. Nice red paint. Not perfect, but looks very good. Black interior with black and white pony seats. This is a driver quality Mustang that should give you many years of good service. It runs and drives really well. Aluminum radiator does its job keeping it cool. The doors close good the windows go up and down fine. The underside is so so. Has had rust repair. Couple of things I really like about this Mustang is it still has it's two barrel carburetor on it and a single exhaust system. This tells me that nobody's really been playing with his car. Adding a 4 barrel carburetor and dual exhaust would add a lot. They have added some really good things like the power, front disc brakes and the aluminum radiator with a cruise fan for better cooling and air conditioning. I took it out and drove it on the back roads in the farm country just north of us. It drove great. I drove it back from Sedro-Woolly also. So I put a total of about 30 miles on it. It was in the low 80s and the engine temperature was rock solid never overheating or anything. Make sure you watch our video that will show you the car totally giving you views of the underside all around the exterior and the interior. You will see the engine compartment in the trunk.We also take it down the freeway. Category 1966_ford_mustang"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Price is $39500.00"}]}

My point is I got this from a Mustang expert and it's a really exceptional car! EXTERIOR All original rust-free metal on this southern California car! The paint is over 20 years old, repainted Raven Black. It was laid out with expert precision then polished to a smooth and slick finish. Literally, I can shave in the reflection.

If you are in the market for a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro that sports a ton of eye appeal with an even better driving experience, then you won't want to miss this one! In the paragraphs to follow we will give a brief description of the exterior, interior, and heartbeat of this Camaro but first we would like to tell you a little about us.

To contact us for more information, pictures, or any questions call our office at (865)988-8088 or visit our SmokyMountainTraders website. First, we will start with the exterior of this First-generation Camaro. This vehicle underwent a comprehensive frame-off restoration that has been very well maintained and cared for. We can see that it has the original Frost Green color scheme that was updated to a basecoat clearcoat combo at the time of the restoration. The frost green is accented by the Baldwin Motion Black stripe. As we look at the vehicle, you'll notice that the whole car is still sporting the original sheet metal except for the hood, which was updated to a metal Baldwin hood during the restoration. The paint on this Camaro has been wet sanded, buffed, and polished out to a stunning finish that's slick. Both the front and rear bumpers are in great condition, and they sport a set of guards on them. We can also see that this '69 sports the rear spoiler and front chin spoiler. All the body lines come together seamlessly, and all the gaps are symmetrical. The glass is still original except for the windshield which was replaced during the restoration. To bring the whole look together it's sitting on a set of 15 Torque Thrust wheels that ride on a set of BF Goodrich Radial T/A tires with a 215/65/R15 in the front and a 255/60/R15 in the rear. Next, we will move on to the interior of this '69 Camaro. We can see that the Interior looks to be mostly original and in phenomenal condition for its age. It's a statement of how well this car has been cared for throughout its entire life. The door panels are in great condition and all the carpet is in amazing condition as well. Both Factory green Bucket seats are in stunning condition with no tear marks on them and the same can be said of the rear bench seat. The headliner is in very good condition for its age along with the sun visors. There are some light signs of aging from the factory bows in the headliner. As we look at the dash, we will notice that it is in very good condition with no cracks or signs of fading. This vehicle has a nice woodgrain steering wheel and located behind the wheel we can see that it has a set auto meter gauges for fuel, water, and oil. We can also see that it has a column-mounted tachometer that is in working condition. The shifter ball has been polished along with the handle and it's set up with a line lock option. We can also notice there is a switch below the dash that electronically opens the exhaust cutouts. The center console is in great condition with no cracks and works as it should. Inside the trunk is all rock solid with the pans and jams being rock solid. It's detailed out with the trunk mat along with having the spare with the Hooker cover. Lastly, we will get to the heartbeat of this Chevrolet. Under the Baldwin Hood, we can see that there is a Supercharged 383 V8 that's set up with the Weiand Sportsman 4V Intake with a Holley 700 Double Pump Carb. It's dressed in the Vortech Powerhat and the Baldwin Motion style Aluminum Finned Valve Covers. The supercharged 383 is mated to the Muncie 4 Speed Manual transmission with the line lock set up and flows out back through the 10 Bolt Posi rear with an estimated 4.10 gears. This is a Baldwin Motion Replica build with the 383 being professionally built by Noble Racing. This 383 has been paired with a Vortech V3 Supercharger kit. It's set up with an MSD ignition system on the vehicle. This Camaro has headers with dual pipes that feature the H pipe and a set of electric cutouts; the cutouts dump into a 3-inch pipe that will be sure to turn heads anywhere you go. The suspension has been upgraded with a set of traction bars and aftermarket sway bars. Also, all new bushings were installed in the front end. This Camaro comes equipped with Power Steering along with Power Brakes that feature disc brakes on the front. To keep it cool it's been upgraded to an Aluminum Radiator. When we look under it you are sure to be impressed as it sports all the original floor pans that are rock solid and in amazing condition. The frame rails are rock solid as well and the front subframe is excellent as well, they installed new body bushings at the time of the restoration. We can also see it has had a new gas tank installed along with new fuel and brake lines!

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You estimate prices of items. Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1971 Ford Mustang\n1971 Ford Mustang Mach 1 1971 was the tail end of a radical period of performance Mustangs. In '69 and '70, you could opt for a GT, Boss 302, Boss 429, Shelby GT350, Shelby GT500, and the Mach I. In '71, choices dwindled to the Boss 351 and the Mach 1. If we all had a crystal ball back then, we would have picked up as many performance Mustangs as possible and tucked them away in secure storage only to pull them out and sell at the right time, whenever that may be. These cars were priced between $2,700 and about $5,300 which seems like chicken feed today, but $5,300 is equal to $44,800 in today's money, so amassing a collection in 1970 would not have been that easy. For consignment, a 1971 Ford Mustang Mach 1, showing 72,679 miles which are non actual. As the brochure prompted, Put yourself into a '71 Mustang. Then put your mark on it with this challenging selection of better idea options. . And indeed, three different rooflines, three different engines, and six different models gave shoppers different levels of performance and luxury to choose from. 36,496 people walked away with Mach 1's in 1971, but none came in this interesting color! Exterior Burnt Orange is a color we've grown accustomed to in 2024 and looks good on the big body of the Mach 1, finished in two stage base/clear for lasting gloss. And there's lots of sinister black here to contrast the orange, and it works well. The bumpers, chin spoiler, hexagon grille, body stripe, and spoiler are all black and are complemented by smoked, modernized headlights, window trim, and the classic rear fascia which picks up on the hexagons and lens trim. Chrome lovers need not fret however, as the 15-inch US Mag wheels offer some metallic shine to the profile. And what a profile! It's the distinctive Sportsroof offered in '71 on both the Mach and the Boss, but you could also get a base Mustang with that large, sloping rear. But what it didn't have were the aggressive intake scoops in the hood, now iconic triangular ducts that also graced the Boss 351. The paint and panel gaps are nice here with imperfections noted only as a deep scratch on the rear valance, some bubbling down low, and some rust on the very bottom corner of a door. Interior The guards in the 1971 film Escape from Planet of the Apes wore black vests with geometric patterns that were trending at the time and seen on the door panels of this car, in black vinyl, with squares and circles embossed in the material. Tight black vinyl with design lines covers the newly upholstered tall back bucket seats in front and look great and material and conditions are copied in the 2+2 seating in back where the rising roof provides good headroom. A GT steering wheel fronts a black painted cluster surround, and three round gauges are in plain view of the driver. A row of three gauges heads the center stack under a cubby and above an AM radio and that leads to the vent controls and an analog clock. The dash pad is a black affair covered in textured vinyl and roughly cut in some areas, while the center console is a tidy arrangement of the standard Ford shifter in front of a formed plastic storage bin. Black loop carpet is in good condition as is the stitched headliner above our heads. The large trunk wears a new liner. Drivetrain Under the massive hood we find a clean 351ci Cleveland V8 with a 4-barrel carburetor, headers, and a C4 3-speed automatic transmission. Power is sent to the Ford 8 in back and the momentum is halted by power disc brakes up front and power drums in the rear which are part of an upgrade made by a previous owner, along with suspension components. Undercarriage On the hunt for new components, we do find the leaf springs to be fresh, along with sway bars and other obviously new pieces. Along with the leaf springs in back, the car has coil springs in the front. Dual exhaust comes off the header and through glasspack style mufflers finally exiting through straight pipes escorted through the rear of the car via cutouts in the valance. There's some typical patina otherwise and a few drops of oil on the pan, but nothing waving red flags underneath. Drive-Ability There's a charm in the simplicity of it all. A few gauges, a basic shifter, and an orderly interior, not much to distract from the task at hand, driving. And with a turn of the key, you become alert and aware, there's no cruise control, lane assist, or ABS. You're all in. Our ride was gratifying in that the 351 puts out plenty of power and has a nice growl to go along with it. The car handles well on the newer suspension and brakes are on point. We note the dash lights don't illuminate and the tach is not working. All other items operate as they should. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. Here's a real deal Mach 1 in a unique color with some tasteful trim work, a distinctive shape, and some of the meanest hood scoops in the business! It's well sorted and ready for both show and go. The further we get from 1971, the more collectible these seem to be, and the Sportsroof that once seemed unusual and out of place, now makes them unique and special. This big bodied 'Stang is ready for a new stable.

The Hamel, Illinois, based Bronco specialists created the handcrafted 4-wheeler in a frame-off build, from the powder coated frame and Raptor-lined undercarriage to the color-matched removable hardtop. The body was stripped to bare metal at the Gateway Bronco Factory'' and refinished in Candy Apple Red paint. Steel impact bumpers with a front winch and rear swing-out spare tire carrier and rear-mounted combination jerry can/cargo carrier augment legendary 4x4 capability. Blackout trim, badges, wiper arms and door handles add distinction. LED headlights and a center lightbar turn darkness into daylight. The Bronco is powered by a 5.0L V-8 engine with electronic fuel injection, aluminum cylinder heads and ceramic-coated stainless exhaust for maximum output and modern driveability. A Ford Racing air cleaner, finned valve covers and an aluminum radiator keep the engine looking and running cool. The small block sends power through a 4-speed automatic transmission, and a 2-speed transfer case distributes the twist to all four wheels through a Dana front differential and 9-inch rear end. More clearance comes by way of Bilstein 2-inch suspension lift. Front and rear sway bars and Wilwood 4-wheel disc brakes with Hydroboost deliver on- and off-road control. Power retractable side steps offer an invite to the air-conditioned cabin. Porsche leather seats with suede inserts and red stitching over wool carpet deliver premium sports touring luxury, and three-point seat belts and a family roll bar add modern safety. Power windows with vintage handles and a Classic Instruments all-electronic factory replica instrument cluster exude original '70's style. A concealed Alpine sound system, and Tuffy locking center console with embroidered armrest and cup holders bring modern entertainment and impervious security to the factory formula. The bespoke Bronco waits for its next owner to take the wood rimmed steering wheel and create new adventures on satin black finish slot mags and BF Goodrich All-Terrain KO2 tires.

These colors on a '69 Camaro with RS-SS features is a very desirable find. Well, it doesn't stop there, it's a convertible with a 4-speed too. I sold this car 24 years ago! We have pictures and a stack of receipts documenting the professional build. A significant amount of restoration was done from new paint to a GM crate engine. Less than 3,000 miles have been put on since completion. What a knockout! EXTERIOR This color combo is to die for! The Hockey stick stripe is painted on and plays perfectly off the interior. The body was media blasted and professionally restored. When looking down the side it is 100% straight as an arrow. All the panels are flush and square with correct alignment and consistent gaps that are well above average. The doors close easily with minimal effort. The paint was neatly laid out and has a mirror like finish. The white vinyl top is in great shape and it comes with the correct white boot as well. The chrome all looks nice and has a lustrous shine. A $1,100 LED exterior light kit was recently installed. The front grille and hideaway headlights are in great condition. The optional spoilers and cowl induction hood really enhance the profile. It's sitting on 15 Rally wheels with a polished lip and SS Spinner center caps that are wrapped in BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires. INTERIOR Awesome! Very nice and clean, functional interior that's the perfect blend of original and refurbished pieces. The springs and cushions for all the seats have been redone and the upholstery was replaced too. The Hurst 4 speed manual shifter proudly sits front and center. Water temp and oil pressure gauges were added under the dash. Seatbelts front and back, so you can cruise with the entire family. There is a modern stereo concealed in the glove box, and the 6x9 speakers can easily be removed if you need the extra space. All the interior lights are also working. ENGINE COMPARTMENT This 350-330 hp GM crate engine offers the ultimate in reliability and is ready to cruise. 2 taps on the gas, then a tap of the key and you are ready to go. The functional cowl induction hood forces air into the engine, and long tube headers let the air flow out. It is topped off with a Holley Demon carb and Edelbrock intake manifold, it is also equipped with power brakes. All the hoses, wires and belts were replaced. The Optima red top gel battery is properly secured and also has a master cut off. The horns are hooked up and the original trim tag is still in place. The underside of the hood is painted just like the body and the remaining metal was all neatly painted satin black. TRUNK COMPARTMENT The underside of the trunk lid and jamb are painted slick just like the body. The weatherstrip was replaced. Inside is all solid and rust free metal with a neatly applied spatter finish paint. It's equipped with a space saver spare, jack assembly, lug wrench and rubber mat. UNDERSIDE The invoices show that the front end was rebuilt and disc brakes were installed in front. All 4 shocks have been replaced. The floor pans have also been replaced. Just recently the fuel tank, sending unit and straps were replaced. The exhaust looks like it's new also. Looking up at the engine it's still very clean and has a high torque starter. There's also an invoice for rebuilding the M-20 Muncie 4 speed manual transmission, so that looks fresh too. SERVICE We inspected the car and repaired a stiff throttle pedal, replaced loose shift knob, installed a reverse light switch, repaired window molding, installed door bumpers, repaired the top, and reworked the e-brake release. If you want to look cool while having a ton of fun and not drain the 401K, this drop top Camaro is perfect for you! The turnkey crate 350 engine should provide years of thought free cruising pleasure, and the tuxedo color combination will turn heads everywhere you go. This professional build was done totally right! For nearly 30 years, I, Jay Grams, have personally written the highlights for almost every car in our collection. What I provide is my professional opinion based on my experience with these vehicles. However, opinions can vary, and I strongly recommend a personal inspection to form your own view.

Originally sold to Wayne Dockterr of Richfield, Minnesota, on May 10, 1965, from Major Motors Inc. in Minneapolis, this Mustang has undergone mechanical restoration, making it an exciting investment for any collector or enthusiast. Engine and Performance The heart of this Mustang is a brand-new 289ci long block, installed in 2020. The engine was professionally built and painted to match the factory colors, with performance upgrades that include a Comp Cam XE256h camshaft, Weiand Street Warrior intake manifold, and a Holley Street Demon 625cfm 4-barrel carburetor. The motor has been machined, magna-fluxed, and bored .030 over, with new pistons and fully overhauled heads. The engine, still running on its royal purple break-in oil, has yet to 20 miles on the road since the installation, offering great potential for the next owner. The freshly rebuilt C4 automatic transmission, complete with a new converter, ensures smooth shifting and a solid driving experience. This Mustang also features a custom dual exhaust system with throaty mufflers, delivering a powerful sound. The car starts up with a low, smooth idle and runs with impressive power. Though only a handful of miles have been put on it since restoration, it is a Mustang with plenty of muscle, just waiting to be enjoyed. Exterior and Body Condition*** Finished in classic Wimbledon White paint, this Mustang's body presents beautifully, but it does show some minor blemishes, including a few areas of blistering and some scratches. It's possible the car had been repainted at some point in its life. While the body does have a couple of imperfections, it's still a solid foundation. The convertible top is in excellent shape, and the tires show plenty of tread depth, offering good grip. The windows do require some attention, as they are a little tight going up and down. The rear side glasses could benefit from a cleaning and greasing of the tracks to ensure smooth operation. Interior Condition*** The interior of this 1965 Mustang Convertible remains largely original and is in fantastic shape. The factory blue vinyl bucket seats are beautiful and show minimal wear for their age. The dashboard is clean and intact, with the original odometer fully functional. This Mustang's interior adds to its overall charm, offering a comfortable and stylish ride for those looking to enjoy classic car motoring in style. Underbody and Frame*** The undercarriage of this Mustang is solid overall, but there is some rust present in the floor pans. This is a common issue with vintage vehicles, and it could either be left as is or addressed by the new owner at their discretion. The car's solid structure still makes it an excellent foundation for restoration or enjoyment as-is. Documentation and History*** This Mustang was originally delivered to Richfield, Minnesota, and comes with the original owner's manual, as well as a stack of receipts for the engine components and restoration work. A $3,700 receipt for the engine alone reflects the significant investment made to bring this classic to life. Summary*** With its upgraded 289ci V8 engine and rebuilt C4 transmission, this 1965 Ford Mustang Convertible offers a thrilling driving experience, with the added benefit of a beautiful original interior and solid mechanical upgrades. The car does show some minor cosmetic imperfections but is in fantastic mechanical shape, with an engine that's ready to roar. For any collector or enthusiast looking for an exciting project or a fun weekend cruiser, this Mustang represents the perfect blend of vintage style, muscle car performance, and craftsmanship.

In 1969, the designers of the Mustang Mach 1 created one of the meanest-looking muscle cars of the era. Jump ahead 36 years - the '69 Mach 1 was the obvious design basis for the 5th generation 2005 Mustang GT. The original Mach 1 utilized Mustang's 'Sportsroof' body and added numerous visual enhancements including a black hood treatment w/hood pins, hood scoop, Mach 1 side strips, front spoiler, and chrome pop-open gas cap. This nicely restored 1969 Mach 1 was carefully refinished in original Meadowlark Yellow (code W), a handsome 2-stage finish that is in outstanding condition. Chromed Mach 1 styled steel wheels w/centers-rings mount 15 performance tires and a rear window louver and spoiler have been fitted. A fully restored black vinyl interior features high-back bucket seats, tinted windows, Lecarra custom wheel, center console, full gauge cluster, and enhanced AM/FM sound system. The owner states that the 351ci Windsor is a matching numbers motor. It is equipped with a Holley 4-barrel carburetor, electronic ignition, and factory exhaust manifolds to a free-flowing system. An auxiliary electric fan aids cooling and based on data tag the Windsor is backed by an FMX automatic transmission and open differential with 3.25 1 gearing. The HD suspension is tight and the chassis is equipped with power steering and power disc/drum brakes. A Marti Report is also included with the car. This classic Mach 1 is a piece of Blue Oval history from a time when muscle cars ruled the streets. It is an investment that will not disappoint.

This is a minor repair.4.Minor leaking at rear right axle that is contaminating the right rear brake and causing the parking brake to slip.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You estimate prices of items. Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1969 Chevrolet Camaro\nOnce you make the decision to resurrect an old-school muscle car using modern technology, there is a right way and several wrong ways to do it. But, oftentimes, finding the right way means having to learn a few of those wrong ways first. Well, one look at this 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Restomod LSX, and it's clear that this first-gen Pony Car was redone about as right as it gets. Fully repainted in its smoke-grey exterior paint, black hockey stick-shaped side decals complement the aggressive lines of this Camaro, huge power-coated blacked-out wheels, and a subtle yet suggestive cowl-induction hood that, along with the tastefully placed LSX badges, suggest that this is a bit more than your father's muscle car. Inside this beautiful beast, we find a deep, dark, and inviting custom TMI interior complete with plush and supportive bucket seats, power windows, and air conditioning. A Billet Specialties three-spoke power-assisted steering wheel sits in front of a hybrid analog/digital dashboard, while a Kenwood AM/FM/Aux/Bluetooth touchscreen handles, among other things, soundtrack duties to keep the vibe in sync with your emotions as it pumps out from the big kick panel speakers next to your feet. Under that cowl hood, we find a clean, body-color engine bay that houses a massive 427 cubic-inch LSX motor. Built with a Stage 3 cam and forged internals, this powerhouse is topped with PRC LS7 aluminum cylinder heads fed with electronic fuel injection and exhales with a set of long tube headers and, finally, out through a Borla dual exhaust. That massive power is routed through a Tremec T56 six-speed manual transmission operated by the Chevy Performance Parts cueball shifter sitting mid-console waiting for you to start rowing. Not only is this 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Restomod LSX built to be a boulevard bruiser, but unlike its original setup, this car is configured to tackle the twisties with the same alacrity as the dragstrip. Riding on a SpeedTech front frame and suspension that uses a power rack and pinion, this Camaro gets a set of high-end Viking coilovers in all four corners to help it stay glued to the pavement.

What a crime to waste it on children. . It was the car to have it you were seeking the fountain of youth. The 1966 Ford Mustang was the car to have if you were looking to win over your neighbor or hit the road for fun and adventure. It was also a must have for enthusiastic drivers and car enthusiasts who simply liked to drive. For consignment, a 1966 Ford Mustang convertible that our consignor states is a smooth driver. This car has a mere 95,765 miles on the odometer and this count is backed up by the title, was formerly restored with factory creature comforts such as Ford power steering, an added power brake booster, some snappy dress ups, and Cragar wheels. It is all looking just fine with this consignment, a very stellar example of what the allure of owning a Mustang was in 1966. Exterior The prancing horse works its way across the front horizontally barred grille and is flanked on either corner upfront, a single headlight is recessed into the finned panels directly next to the grille and the body matching headlight bezel. Just below a simple chromed shiny bumper is attached, and below this is another body matching panel with round signal lights and a license plate holder area. Meanwhile FORD badging races across the hood which goes rearward all the while being flanked by the front quarters with their badging just behind the wheel well. For the well minded gapped doors, the beginnings of the hockey stick cove which ends in an angled contour on the front of the rear quarter, and now you can see why it is called the hockey stock cove! For this consignment, warranty plate correct Springtime Yellow drenches the body and shows with some inclusions, paint pops, bubbling and evidence of body work on the lowers. On top is a nice black canvas convertible roof, and surrounding windows sport nice trimmings. The top has light soiling and a slightly hazed plastic rear window. For the back, the iconic dual trios of outward V shaped tail lights with nice bezels between each V, a centrally located Mustang badged gas cap, and dual angle cut exhaust tips poking from the rear valance. Shiny chrome 14-inch Cragar SS wheels finish off the bottom of this breath of spring air car. Interior Looking inside one has to wonder if this is the correct interior combination and according to my crack decoder, this is correct as per the warranty plate and he says it grows on you. I agree and this warm and inviting Emberglow luxury vinyl is in full bloom here, with said material on the door panels, seats, and headliner. All surfaces present well with some possibly being original to the car. Seats have ivory tuck and roll inserts along with the Pony Package upholstery, (Luxury Interior Package), and smooth surrounding bolsters. Upfront an original dash is seen in black and in true Mustang form, rounded gauges with shiny chrome bezels and wood applique backdrop, which are in panels created by the dual curved padded bronze dash top. In the center is an AM/FM/Cassette radio and the temp sliders. Emberglow carpet floods the floors and has the simple T style shift lever in the middle of the hump within the long and racing ribbed aluminum console that raises up to meet the dash. A shout out to the trunk, where we can see some nice plaid vinyl covering the interior of the trunk floor, complete with spare tire and jack setup. All fairly clean and presenting nicely for the overall interior. Drivetrain The original 289ci V8 takes root under the hood and is in a nice engine bay which presents with a slight dustiness and patina with supple wires and hoses. This mill shows in a chipped and faded blue and is topped with chrome valve covers and a 2bbl carburetor on top. On back is a correct C4 Cruise-O-Matic 3-speed automatic transmission and power is put to the ground through a Ford 8 2.80 geared conventional rear axle. Undercarriage Fully restored with glossy black paint on the shock towers, unibody rails and flooring repairs that has left this undercarriage rust free and structurally sound underneath. Power steering is noted and power hydraulic drum brakes all around. Independent front coil spring suspension is on and in back the leaf spring setup is bolted to solid steel framing. Underneath door panels at the bottoms some rust drippings but no invasive rust seen here. Drive-Ability My mother had one of these in this form but a different color, so I remember driving with her in it. I've never driven one, so I jumped at the chance mostly due to the style and the memories. This car started easily, and with a short warmup to get her going smoothly, it was off to the test track. Here it had nice acceleration, snappy steering, and good braking. All was well with functions too and there is nothing quite like a late summer drive with the top down. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. A good example of this popular car, with nice paint, chrome and some extras. It runs like a champ, has good documented miles, and has been restored to be enjoyed and driven. The color combo is good, and the black top is very nicely preserved. Simple but elegant, this car definitely will grow on you. 6T08C118184 6-1966 T-Metuchen, NJ Assy Plant 08-Mustang Convertible C-289ci 2bbl V8 118184-Sequential Unit Number WARRANTY PLATE BODY 76B-Mustang Convertible, Luxury Interior COLOR 8-Springtime Yellow TRIM 64-Emberglow & Parchment Luxury Vinyl DATE 30J-September 30th DSO 23-Philadelphia AXLE 6-Ford 8 2.80 Conventional TRANS 6-C4 Automatic Classic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and collectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate controlled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8 acres!).

This Camaro was born back in early December of '67 with Granada Gold paint and a black vinyl top, but it appears before us today with no vinyl top and a high driver-quality respray in a slightly lighter shade of gold with some pearl mixed in to really make it pop in the light. Up front, you'll see a black egg crate grille with rs badging and the highly desirable, electronically-operated hidden headlights. A black bumblebee stripe, black chin spoiler, chrome faux hood vents, and gleaming chrome grille complete the look of this iconic front end. The fender badging is in very good condition and properly placed, matching the rest of the badging on the car. Being an RS package car, brightwork abounds with wheel lip molding, drip rail molding, rocker covers, window trim, dual side mirrors, and door handles. Dark tinted windows make this brightwork seem all the more brilliant. The rear of the car features another bright chrome bumper, an rs gas cap, bright tail light trim, and a spoiler on the trunk lid. This Camaro has an awesome stance as it sits atop steel Rally wheels with short-center hubcaps and beauty rings, all wrapped in brand new white-letter BF Goodrich Radial T/A's. Under the hood is a very clean and presentable engine bay that is home to a 350ci GM crate V-8. The 350 is topped with chrome Chevrolet valve covers, a GM aluminum intake, an Edelbrock 4-barrel carburetor, and a chrome Edelbrock air cleaner. Also under the hood is a Be-Cool aluminum radiator with dual electric fans, HEI ignition, power steering, power brakes (disc/drum), and working A/C. The V-8 is mated to a 700R4 4-speed automatic overdrive transmission that puts power to the pavement via a 10-bolt rear end with 3.73 1 positraction gears. This stellar drivetrain combo is perfect for laying some rubber or just cruisin' down the freeway! Cast manifolds lead back to a newer exhaust with Magnaflow mufflers that sound amazing. While checking out the exhaust you'll see that the bottom of the car was undercoated at some point and it is still in fantastic condition. Open the driver's door and the courtesy lights come on to illuminate an immaculate black interior. The OEM-style door panels are both in great condition and feature factory power windows. Up front are black standard vinyl bucket seats in excellent shape with no signs of wear and tear. The bench seat in the back looks like it has never been used. Between the buckets is an exceptionally nice center console that was installed in 2022. The console has a storage box, a new shifter (also 2022) with the correct shift indicator for the 4-speed automatic, and working gauges for fuel, temp, battery, and oil, plus a clock. Up on the dash is a Custom Autosound AM/FM bluetooth stereo hooked up to two Classic Car Audio 6X9s on the rear package tray. Above the stereo are factory climate controls that provide nice cold A/C and hot heat with a working fan. Ahead of the driver on the dash are a speedometer, tachometer, and controls for the headlights and the 2-speed wipers. The driver is treated to a 3-spoke wood steering wheel from Grant on a tilt column. Overhead is a tight black vinyl headliner and underfoot is a high-quality hook loop carpet. Back in the trunk, you'll find a houndstooth vinyl mat, a set of black rubber Chevy logo floormats, a jack, and a spare Rally wheel with a BF Goodrich tire. If you're looking for a first generation Camaro you're going to want to take a close look at this '67. This is a very high-quality build that checks all the boxes - slick paint, great stance, hideaway headlights, RS trim package, power steering, power brakes, power windows, cold A/C, strong running V-8, automatic overdrive transmission, and a beautiful interior! There is a lot to love about this awesome Camaro!

Under long-term enthusiast ownership for the last decade, this truck underwent a restoration four years ago which included a high-quality repaint, all new interior and many mechanical upgrades. Finished in dark blue with a black soft top, paint is very nice over a straight and solid body. Bumpers, seals and badges were replaced and the quarter vent windows in the doors were also restored (an often overlooked detail). 15-inch chrome steel wheels are wearing BF Goodrich 33x12.50 all terrain tires, along with a full-size matching spare on a heavy-duty bumper-mounted swing-away tire carrier. The black soft top with tinted (and removable) windows is brand new. Interior presents beautifully with custom high-back bucket seats with a fold-and-tumble rear seat tastefully finished in brown diamond-stitched leatherette. Door panels, rear quarter trim panels, dash pad and armrest are upholstered to match. The locking center console provides two adjustable cupholders, secure storage, and houses a modern bluetooth stereo. A custom family-style roll cage affords three-point seat belts for both the front and rear occupants. All gauges, switches and lights are, of course, working. An attractive wood-rimmed steering wheel fronts a new chrome-plated tilt steering column. Windshield wipers have been converted to a dual electric motor setup for reliable operation without any clunky linkages. Under the hood is a 351 cubic inch Cleveland V8 mated to a five-speed manual transmission and a twin-stick dual-range transfer case. The engine has been upgraded with Holley Sniper electronic fuel injection along with electronic ignition (the digital display for the EFI system is discreetly mounted inside the glove box). Other options include power steering and power brakes with four-wheel disks, plus a VintageAir heating and cooling system which integrates heat, defrost and a/c into a single set of controls. Suspension components were all renewed four years ago, including Bilstein shocks and a two-inch lift. This Early Bronco runs and drives great and is certainly a head turner wherever it goes. It has a great look with a bespoke interior and many desirable upgrades. For more information about this 1967 Ford Bronco for sale at Motorcar Studio in Savannah, please call .

The body is covered in the Wimbledon White that's accented by the Guardsman Blue Top Stripes and blue side stripes. This Mustang has been buffed and polished to a deep rich shine that's slick as ribbon. Both the bumpers, tail light bezels, gas cap, front grill and even the turn signal bezels are all like new. All the glass looks excellent and the stainless around it is also in great condition. To finish off the exterior it's sitting on the 15x6 Cragars that were built for Shelby Cars and they have Cooper Cobra Tires. On the inside, it's also done in the classic black which is how the Shelbys came. Everything is like new from the seats, which have been recovered and had the padding redone, to the Headliner that has an excellent fit. The Door panels have also been replaced and are in great condition. Also, the carpet was replaced along with the seal plates. Looking at the dash it's got the GT Gauge cluster that's all working from the 140 MPH Speedo to the Dash Mounted Tach. This Mustang has the stock style shifter that was built to work with the Five Speed Trans. A set of 2-point lap belts were added along with a Shelby Wood Wheel and an aftermarket Tilt Column. Under the hood it's equally impressive, featuring a 289 that has been upgraded with a set of 351 Heads and an aftermarket set of TRW Aluminum Rockers.

Ford changed the visuals of the Mach 1 in 1970 with the body that included dual-beam headlights, recessed taillights on a black honeycomb rear panel, side scoops behind both doors removed, revised bucket seats, deep dish sports wheel covers, as well as new side and rear badging and striping.

In the mid-1960s, among the race of America's Big Three automakers to build some of the best muscle cars ever produced, a new sub-genre of muscle cars-the Pony Car-were introduced when Ford introduced its Mustang. Sporty, cool, affordable, and youth-oriented are all descriptors of the Pony Car and early on, they were massive sales successes. At first, only two of the three Big Three even offered a Pony Car, Ford had its Mustang and Chrysler (through its Plymouth marque) had the Barracuda. However, General Motors, the biggest of the Big Three, did not quite have its own Pony Car. Specifically, Chevrolet's leadership realized that the Corvair and the Chevy II/Nova were not quite cutting it as far as a true Pony Car competitor. That all changed in 1967 when Chevy introduced its own Pony Car, the Camaro. The Camaro essentially replicated the traditional pony car formula consisting of a small, sporty body paired with a high performance drivetrain, all for a modest price. As could be expected, the Camaro was a major success for the GM marque with over two-hundred thousand units sold in that first year. Hoping to coast off the tailwinds of the 1967 Camaro, Chevrolet opted for minimal changes in its 1968 reprise of the mega-hit Camaro. Now the 1968 Camaro wasn't entirely a copy of the 1967 version, it could be said that the new 1968 Camaro was a new and improved version of the Camaro that everybody already fell in love with. Upgrades in 1968 were highlighted by a more modern wraparound windshield, larger door windows, and Astro Ventilation replaced the 1967 Camaro's vent windows. Additionally, due to new government regulations, rectangular marker lights were added in '68 as well. The 1968 Camaro was also a lot more comfortable than the previous year thanks to upgraded suspension as well as plusher interiors. This particular '68 Camaro comes to us from a southern-based collector who clearly enjoyed the upgraded performance on this pony car. Powering this '68 Camaro is an upgraded 396 Cubic Inch V8 engine fed by a single 4 barrel carburetor. The 396 V8 is backed by 4 speed manual transmission that makes this classic pony car a super fun car to drive. The Chevy big block power plant sports several performance upgrades including an Edelbrock Performer aluminum intake manifold and upgraded headers. Exhaust from the headers exits through the rear tailpipes via a throaty dual exhaust setup that anybody can enjoy. This classic Camaro rides on a set of BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires mounted on Rally Wheels and accented with Chevy chrome hubcaps and beauty rings. The body on this Camaro has been correctly refinished in British Green Metallic paint, a beautiful color seldom seen today on most restored Camaros. This 1968 Chevrolet Camaro's interior is absolutely gorgeous! The black bucket seats up front and matching rear bench seat are in wonderful condition and they have been correctly reupholstered, retaining the appearance that this Camaro sported when it rolled of the Los Angeles, California, production line back in the late 1960s. The black upholstered door panels, padded dash, black carpeting and steering wheel are all in great shape, and all appear to remain in their stock configuration as well. Instrumentation includes a 120 MPH speedometer with integrated odometer, along with a fuel gauge and various indicator lights. A previous owner astutely and neatly mounted a Sunpro oil pressure gauge and Sunpro Temperature gauge under the dash along with an 8,000 RPM Tachometer for improved visibility into the Big Block found under this Camaro's hood. The woodgrain-trimmed dash is finished off with climate controls, an ashtray, glovebox, and push-button AM radio. Whether you're buying your first classic car or you're adding to an existing collection of classic Pony cars, this 1968 Chevrolet Camaro would make an excellent choice.

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1972 Chevrolet Camaro\n1972 Chevrolet Camaro Hardtop We've learned a lot from Corvette. Here it is. Chevrolet has been building the Corvette for 19 years now. And it's still the only two seat production sports car made in this country. Over the years, we've learned about axle control, springing, weight distribution, aerodynamics, braking, and a lot more from the Corvette. And when we first brought out the Camaro five years ago, we put all that Corvette learning into its design and engineering. From the 1972 Camaro dealer brochure For consignment, a 1972 Chevrolet Camaro hardtop, showing 89,383 miles, but the true miles are unknown. All Camaros were sport coupes and this one was born with a 350ci 2-barrel V8. But today, it's all grown up with a 396ci big block with a 4-barrel carburetor and some SS goodies that are old school cool. Let's get into it. Exterior Two stage Hugger Orange covers this F-body and that alone would be cool enough, but it's got SS stripes that start on the nose, engulf the cowl hood, skip the roof, (appropriately), then track down over the decklid and onto the spoiler, and it's awesome. While we're back here let's take in those epic quad tail lights, so muscular and streaking into the night like afterburners. Below the chrome bumper exists a pair of widespread tailpipes and if this isn't the best angle of the car, it's in the top three! Also in the running is the front, a split bumper portrait with gaping center eggcrate grille and an SS chin spoiler down below. Old school meets new school with 17-inch polished American Racing Torque Thrust wheels wrapped in 45 series orange painted line tires. This thing is like a full sized Hot Wheels car! SS 396 is affixed to the fenders and that's in tribute for this faithful dedication. Imperfections include bubbling in numerous spots, especially down low. Interior Black vinyl and plastic doorpanels greet us without fanfare, these are generally basic and clean. Cloth seats with vinyl borders show some patina, especially the driver's seat where a tear is observed on the upper part. In the back, the 2+2 seats are clean and intact and the front passenger seat is in fine condition. Our 4 spoke steering wheel is missing the horn button and shares the column with a Sunpro tachometer that fronts the typical sporty Camaro instrument cluster based in hard plastic, textured panels. For tunes, we have an AM/FM/Cassette radio, so dig out that box of cassettes we know you have! A triple gauge is below the radio and informs the driver on water, oil, and amps. A mean looking, black knobbed Hurst shifter rises from the center console, also surrounded in textured plastic and our floor is covered in black loop carpet and Chevy rubber mats and it's where we note and celebrate three pedals, and the left two are missing their rubber foot pad. Up top, seatbelts are strapped to the ceiling where we find the black headliner in good condition and a trunk liner sits cleanly in the trunk under a spare tire. Drivetrain Clean and ready for show and go, the 396ci V8 sits proudly in the bay, topped by a 4-barrel carburetor, shedding exhaust through headers, and tied to a T5 5-speed manual transmission sending the spin back to the 10 bolt rear end. And bonus! Power disc brakes have been placed at all four wheels! Undercarriage Very clean underneath with just hints of surface rust and no oil present! The dual exhaust intersect a pair of FlowMaster mufflers and then exit out back through those polished bevel cut tips. A chrome differential cover is not only old school but adds some bling for those you pass to admire. Suspension includes coil springs in front and leaf springs with traction bars in back. Drive-Ability There's no flying under the radar in a Hugger Orange Camaro with wide black stripes, polished wheels and dual exhaust, but we'll do our best. Especially because we stay on the mall property and by now, the neighbors know what to expect, they've seen it all! The 396 powers ahead providing gobs of power and the modern tires provide great traction, tracking, and response to the application of brakes. Other than the horn not being present and available, all other functions in the car work and help transport us back to our high school days when the cool kids drove cars like this. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. Split bumper, SS chin spoiler, rear spoiler, racing stripes. Fun stick and three pedals! Not much not to like about this car and there's an entire generation of car people watching the market for a car like this to appear. This is absolutely another Lester from American Beauty moment. It's a 1972 Camaro 396, the car I've always wanted, and now I have it. I rule! Fist in the air.

The body on it is laser straight down the sides and all the body lines flow seamlessly from front to back. Countless hours were spent prepping this car during restoration, showcased by the F5K Dark Burnt Orange Metallic paint that is the Factory Option. It's accented by the V8X Bumble Bee Stripes, V21 Performance Hood Treatment, and V1X Black Vinyl top, both factory options. The paint was redone in base coat clear coat and has been polished out to a mirror finish that's slick as a ribbon. This '70 has the working hood signals along with having the factory hood tie down option. Both the front and rear bumpers have a brilliant finish. The drip rail molding, wheel opening molding, and belt line molding is all beautiful as well. We can see the grill is in excellent condition along with the headlights that are working as they should. All the glass is excellent as well along with having had all new weather stripping and seals installed. To finish off the stance it's sitting on a set of 15 Magnum 500 wheels with 8 Wheels on the Front and 10 Wheels on the Back. They are riding on a set of BF Goodrich Radial T/A White Letter Tires. Next, we will look at the interior of this R/T. On the inside it's done in the factory option as well with the Burnt Orange color scheme the provides the perfect complement to the exterior. The door panels are all excellent along with the cranks and armrest. It features a driver-side remote mirror. All new carpet and headliner were installed as well and they both have an excellent fit. The factory bucket seats and rear bench seat were all redone with new padding, springs, and covers. We can see the center console is in excellent condition as well and features the wood grain accents while also housing the Four Speed Pistol Grip Shifter. Looking at the gauges we can see how well this car has been cared for because they all look amazing and are working as they should. Inside the trunk is all rock solid and detailed out in body color. It's finished out with the correct trunk liner, jack, and spare. Finally, we will get to the driveline of this Dodge. Under the hood, the same meticulous approach that is evident on the rest of the car is clear here as well. It has the matching radiator support along with having the original fender tag. The power comes from the Matching Numbers U Code 440 V8 that's set up with the original 2951736-1 Intake and original Carter 4737S.

This Charger RT comes with Power Steering and for the exhaust, it has the correct Manifolds with new 2 \ufffd dual pipes with the H Pipe and Xlerator turbo style mufflers. When we look it you can see they did a phenomenal job with the rotisseries resto as they floors are rock solid and just as slick as the top. We can also see that they welded in frame connectors and did an excellent job with the installation before paint. All new fuel and brake lines were installed along with a new gas tank. The 440 U Code engine runs through the Matching Numbers D21 Heavy Duty Four Speed Transmission and the original A33 Track Pak Dana 60 Rear End with 3.54 Gears.

Dubbed the pony car, the Mustang was Fords entry into the muscle car era and it was met with great success. These cars are very popular in the classic car collecting world with entire companies, shows, and clubs dedicated to this model of car alone. This 1965 Ford Mustang is a very unique car in that it has lived with its current owner for 43 years. During that ownership the car has been completely restored. It is painted in a classic Red paint which has a very nice shine and finish. That is paired with a White power convertible top that operates smoothly and it has a White convertible boot when not in place. All of the factory chrome, stainless, and emblems are all there including the iconic Mustang corral grill. The glass is in great condition throughout with a slight upper tint on the front windshield. All of the exterior electrical is nicely mounted in place and all work properly. The car rides on a set of its original wheels with P195/75R14 thin white wall tires. Turning those tires is the a fresh 4 barrel 302 V8 that runs great. The A in the VIN number indicates it was a 289 originally and also that it is a late production car for 1965. The motor is topped off with a nice chrome air cleaner and a majority of the motor is painted in Ford Blue. You will also note it has the factory style shock tower brace and Monte Carlo bar. Recently the car was gone through mechanically and received a bunch of new components. This includes the AC compressor, 4 barrel Holly carburetor, radiator, battery, front shocks, front disc brakes, master cylinder with power brake booster, windshield washer, fuel sending unit, spark plug wires, power steering pump, power steering hoses, and mufflers. The car is turn key and ready to go. With all the luxuries like AC, PS, and PB it really is a joy to drive and comfortable cruiser. The transmission is a C4 automatic and shifts smoothly. The interior is done in a combination of White and Red which really looks sharp. It is all leather and is the deluxe pony interior. It is super clean and has clearly been well cared for since it was completed. Nice Red lap belts have been added for both front and rear passengers. The bucket seats sit to each side of the factory center console that features a chrome t-handle shifter. The dash has an all stock layout and features the Rosewood trim. The gauges all work properly and the fuel gauge was just replaced. The radio is also brand new and sound great. The AC is a stock style underdash unit and it blows cold. In front of the driver sits a great looking Walnut steering wheel with Mustang horn button. The trunk is all nicely carpeted in Red and houses a spare. This is a really nice Mustang that needs nothing but a new garage to call home. Get it while it is still available! It could be yours for $58,950.00!

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1966 Ford Mustang\n1966 Ford Mustang Hardtop In the mid 1950's, Ford modernized its production facilities in Northern and Southern CA, building this new assembly plant in Milpitas, nearby to San Jose, in 1955 to replace its Richmond plant that opened on 08/01/1931. In Southern CA, Ford closed its Long Beach and Maywood facilities, the former opened at about the same time as the Richmond one, replacing both of them in 1956 with a new factory in Pico Rivera. After the plant closed in the 80's, it was turned into a giant mall with over a million square feet. ThxPCAD.lib.washington.edu For consignment, a 1966 Ford Mustang hardtop showing 153,630 miles which are not actual. A car born at the San Jose facility, dressed as a GT350 and presenting with stunning paint, a clean interior, and a binder full of receipts and build records. Exterior The first thing that hits us, and not just because we're standing in its way, is the race ready GT350-R inspired front fascia that includes a lower intake flanked by marker lights under a horseless grille and inset headlights. Then there's the silver stripes that start on said intake and work their way up and are painted across the hood where pins keep the newly sucked air from blowing the hood off. There's some downforce too as a rising hood scoop peels airflow from the hood and sends it down the air filter below. Surrounding the stripes is beautiful Sapphire Blue paint which is interrupted on the rocker panel by GT350 stripes and callouts which team up with the side scoops and 15-inch polished American Racing Torque Thrust wheels for a racier than stock profile. In back, a Cobra emblem adorns the billet style gas cap above a straight and clean chrome bumper and a blue rear valance that holds the exhaust tips and reverse lights. A single vertical scratch represents the only exterior imperfection we could find. Interior Silver paint serves to frame the black vinyl door cards in an attractive twist on the Mustang door panel. The low back bucket seats flank a center console with storage, an armrest, and cupholders that fills an otherwise sparse space and the back seats, surrounded by walls of silver paint, are fresh and clean. The 3 spoke steering wheel gives up some of the polished column real estate to a tachometer and additional gauges in a twin pod are found under the dash. The main gauge cluster is fairly standard although the materials around it have been updated to reflect the silver and black interior palette. An AM/FM radio sits in the center, a straight line up from the floor mounted Hurst shifter with a big white ball handle over low pile black carpet in excellent condition, protected by Boss 302 carpeted mats as a nod to yet another Ford legend. The headliner sits high and tight and along with the visors, is in excellent condition. Carpet that lines the trunk shows some wear but nobody at the car show will care. Drivetrain Under the hood we find a clean 302ci V8 engine with aluminum heads and a Holley 600 cfm 4-barrel perched on top. It's show quality clean and tied to a Toploader 4-speed manual transmission that sends power to the Ford 8 axle in back with a consignor stated 3.73 gears with TracLoc. Unassisted brakes are configured as front disc and rear drums. Undercarriage Wickedly clean and dry underneath with only wisps of surface rust, general usage dust, and no oil drips in sight! The dual exhaust comes from headers on the engine and intersect glasspack style mufflers before routing around the gas tank to exit through the rear valance in epic fashion. Coil springs reside in the front for suspension while leaf springs are employed in the rear. Drive-Ability A healthy breathing 302 fires up and enjoys a bit of sound tuning from the glasspacks and the resulting music is as exciting as the William Tell Overture performed by the Boston Pops. A shift into first with the Hurst and off we go onto the test loop where the car exhibits some fine acceleration, smooth handling, straight tracking, and very good braking. Our symphony will not be interrupted by other sounds as the horn does not work, nor the radio which we're told is disconnected because it drains the battery. All other functions work on this quick blue pony and it's back to the stable we go. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. We think it was Fred Sanford who said, my get up and go, got up and went. . But that's not the case with this 59 year old car that's been refreshed with the fountain of youth. It's got plenty of giddy up and can get up and go, and do so in a stunning combination of silver and blue. A GT350 tribute in notchback form, this is a well sorted Mustang that's ready for the street. It only needs a new jockey. You won't need a horsewhip to get this one going, just a gentle nudge of your right foot. 6R07T160177 6-1966 R-San Jose, CA Assy Plant 07-Mustang Hardtop T-200ci 1bbl I6 160177-Sequential Unit Number WARRANTY PLATE BODY 65A-Mustang Hardtop Standard Vinyl Buckets COLOR F-Arcadian Blue TRIM 22-Blue Standard Vinyl Buckets DATE 01D-April 1st DSO 72-San Jose AXLE 6-Ford 8 2.80 Conventional TRANS 6-C4 Automatic Classic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and collectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate controlled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8 acres!).

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1968 Chevrolet Camaro\nThere is something special about owning a first-generation Pony Car. The spirit of open-road exuberance that can only be provided by a small block V-8 is like no other feeling. One look at this gorgeous Red Metallic 1968 Chevrolet Camaro, and it's easy to see its allure. Whether it is the dual full-length black racing stripes, matching black vinyl top, cowl induction hood, or classic Chevy Rallye wheels that you notice first, this car personifies the true muscle car ethos. We find a set of black vinyl bucket seats separated by a helpful center console. A four-spoke power-assisted steering wheel sits before the big speedometer/tachometer tandem. At the same time, a three-pod gauge cluster at the bottom of the center dash stack adds oil pressure, battery volts, and water pressure readings to the mix. Three sliding HVAC controls offer ease of use we could only dream of today, and while there may not be a radio at the moment, all it takes is a blip of the throttle to give you all the aural excitement you could want. Under that cowl hood sits a modified bored-and-stroked 406 cubic inch V-8 featuring aluminum heads, a single four-barrel Holley double-pumper carburetor, Holley aluminum intake, long tube headers, and a sweet-sounding MagnaFlow exhaust that can flex anytime you want this muscle car to show off a little bit. That power is channeled through a TH400 three-speed automatic transmission before reaching the rear wheels via the 12-bolt rear end. Shod in wide 275/70R-15 rear and staggered 215/60R-15 BFG rubber, this Camaro's 15-inch Rallye wheels complete the aggressive look this car was made to exude. Although it rides on its factory-style suspension, this 1968 Chevrolet Camaro has been beefed up with a trick set of subframe connectors to give it more rigidity running through those tight corners. Front disc brakes (with rear drums) help scrub speed off whenever the need to rein in this pony arises. Highlights *406 CID Stroker V8 *Aluminum Heads *Holley Double Pumper *Holley Aluminum Intake *Long tube headers *MagnaFlow Exhaust *Cowl hood *TH400 Three Speed Auto *Subframe Connectors *Front Disc Brakes *Power Steering Few cars offer the feeling that a first-generation muscle car does, and if you've never experienced that thrill for yourself, don't wait a minute longer.

During the restoration, this car was treated to a new set of the GM chambered exhausts, an option ordered on very few Camaros.

This car also has the optional deck lid and chin spoilers. During its restoration, new body chrome, stainless trim, and a a new black convertible top were fitted. Ordering the SS package was the only way to get a big-block engine in the 1968 Camaro. This car's 396 engine is rated at 325 HP. The torque is handled by a 12-bolt rear axle. Other options include power steering and power brakes, with disc brakes in front. Brand new 7 Rally Wheels and Gold Line tires perfectly complement the colorway of this incredible example.

It needs to be driven every 3-4 days or else the carburetor loses fuel (a workaround exists) Radio - It did work initially but doesn't now, should be an easy fix Please Note The Following **Vehicle Location is at our clients home and Not In Cadillac, Michigan. **We do have a showroom with about 25 cars that is by appointment only **Please Call First and talk to one of our reps at EXT 1 ** Category 1971_ford_bronco"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Price is $50995.00"}]}

Originally a 440-powered R/T, this Charger now flexes serious muscle with a 426 Hemi V8 under its hood. The aggressive stance is accentuated by period-correct 14-inch Chrysler mag wheels with black painted inserts, wrapped in BF Goodrich Radial T/A tires (P225/70R14 front, P225/75R14 rear). A painted metallic gray bumblebee stripe wraps around the rear, paying homage to its muscle car lineage. The bumper chrome shines brilliantly, complementing the sleek, aerodynamic profile that made the '68 Charger a legend on street and track. Inside, the ivory interior creates a striking contrast to the exterior's bold red. Vinyl bucket seats offer both comfort and period-correct style, while the factory center console houses the floor shifter for the 3-speed automatic transmission. The dashboard features factory-style gauges including a tachometer, essential for monitoring the Hemi's performance. An aftermarket steering wheel with a teak wooden perimeter adds a touch of sophistication. Modern conveniences blend seamlessly with classic style - a Premier AM/FM radio provides the tunes, while factory air conditioning keeps the cabin cool during spirited drives. The star of this show is the 426 Hemi V8, built to produce a tire-shredding 550 horsepower on pump gas. The engine bay is a showcase of power and engineering, featuring dual Edelbrock Performer AFB-style four-barrel carburetors with electric chokes, sitting atop a Chrysler aluminum intake manifold. Long tube stainless headers feed into a dual exhaust system for that signature Hemi growl. Performance upgrades continue with a high-performance aluminum radiator and twin electric fans to keep this powerhouse cool. The 3-speed automatic transmission and 8 3/4 rear end with 3.23 gears provide the perfect balance of acceleration and highway cruising ability.

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1966 Ford Mustang\n1966 Ford Mustang Hardtop For the very first time, American's could literally build the car of their dreams, as most American car manufacturers now offered tons of 'extras' or 'options' when ordering a new car. But, it now believed the incredible success of Ford's Mustang was not only due to the marketing by Lee Iacocca but, to the fact the consumer could actually 'build' him, or herself, a custom car by choosing from over 70 options offered for the 1966 Mustang! Many folks did not realize Ford really meant the advertising term, the car that was designed to be designed by YOU. After paying as little as $2368 FOB, you could load your car up with a myriad of options. Thx to FoMoCo.org For consignment, a 1966 Ford Mustang hardtop, one of an astounding 607,568 Mustangs produced in 1966, 422,416 of those being hardtops, far and away the most common body type which also included fastbacks and convertibles. This car was restored more than 12 years ago and has a rebuilt 289ci V8 and was won by our consignor in a raffle. Exterior Assembled in the eastern plant at Metuchen, New Jersey this hardtop wears Wimbledon White, which unlike Carlos Alcaraz's uniform, is actually an off white with a subtle yellow tinge. By 1966, the familiar lines and shape of the Mustang was ingrained in the American psyche so subtle changes from the 1965 such as the new faux ducts on the quarter panel, the removal of the vertical bar from the grille horse's corral, and the change from a honeycomb grille design to one with straight bars were barely noticed by the public but serve as important differentiators today. This car is missing the panel ducts for a clean unobstructed body line that creates a soft cove. The chrome and bright work are very nice on the car and wheel covers on the 14-inch wheels show a bit of patina but are entirely presentable. The paint is in beautiful condition on the car with no notable flaws however a few of the panel gaps are less than perfect, and sometimes they left that plant that way. Interior Black was the simple title of the interior palette and begins with the door panels in varying patterns of vinyl and housing manual locks, crank windows, and a corner wind window secured by a metal latch. Inside, standard low back bucket seats with tuck and roll insert are situated up front while 2+2 seating that essentially flank the center tunnel live in the back and everything is in very fine condition. The steering wheel fronts a simple dash where five gauges present to the driver including the large, center 140mph speedometer housed in textured hard plastic showing, typically, a bit of patina. Metal switchgear provides robust controls and an AM/FM/Cassette player is in the center, reachable from driver and passenger alike. A center console is striped with finned metal trim that breaks for the T-handle shifter and indicator plate. Black loop carpet covers the floor nicely and the headliner is a bit loose but fully intact. The trunk is clean and lined with a period plaid mat. Drivetrain Under the hood, a clean, driver quality 289ci V8 rebuilt by Jasper Engines who put a slight cam in and added headers, along with a Holley 4-barrel carburetor. A C4 3-speed automatic transmission sends power to the Ford 8 rear and drum brakes bring it all to a crawl. Undercarriage Driver quality underneath as well where surface rust is common including on the exhaust which flows from the headers to a pair of stock style muffler, then out chrome down turned tips that extend past the rear valance. It's relatively clean and dry otherwise underneath with no grease build up, some road spray that can be hosed off, and no leaks other than some residual oil on the rear differential. Coil springs make up the suspension in front and leaf springs are out back and we note some rust repair was performed on the front of the driver's inner rocker panel. Drive-Ability The healthy little V8 fired right up and the Mustang trotted onto the test loop with adequate power, good tracking, and braking that functioned well. No surprises here and other than the horn not working, all other functions such as lights, radio, turn signals and others worked as expected. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. Here's a nice, basic pony, well sorted, showing no invasive rust, and a complete, clean interior. If a hardtop classic Mustang is on your wishlist, be sure to add this Wimbledon White example to your search. This one is an ace and once you make the call, it will be game, set, match! The ball's in your court. 6T07C262055 6-1966 T-Metuchen, NJ Assy Plant 07-Mustang Hardtop C-289ci 200hp 2bbl V8 262055-Sequential Unit Number Classic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and collectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate controlled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8 acres!).

The Mustang has been a phenomenon since its introduction in 1964. Considered Fords longest running production car as the nameplate is still used today. With over one million units sold in the first two years the Mustang is truly an American success story. Leading competitors were quick to get into the pony car craze including the Chevrolet Camaro, Pontiac Firebird and AMC Javelin. This 1965 Ford Mustang is painted in light teal accented with racing stripes, dual mirrors, and a set of chrome five-spoke steel wheels mounted on raised white letter tires, The black vinyl interior consists of Pony bench seating w/ armrest, floor shifter, seat belts, factory AM radio, and a three-spoke sport steering wheel. Under the hood is a 302 V-8 attached to a three-speed automatic transmission. Power steering makes for a responsive/ enjoyable driving experience.

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1971 Ford Mustang\n1971 Ford Mustang Convertible Outside of the 1971 Boss 351, the convertible was produced in the fewest numbers. Just 6,121 were created and who knows how many are still roadworthy. Let's just say, this is an uncommon car. As 1970 models were one year designs, 1971 ushered in a new look which lasted three years. Then came the 1974's which were met with some vocal consternation. In contrast, the '71-'73 retained at least a hint of Mustang's glory days. For consignment, a one family owned garage kept 1971 Ford Mustang convertible born in Dearborn, Michigan with a 351ci Cleveland V8 under the hood. It presents in good original condition and it's ultimately restorable if that's the direction the new owner wants to go. Exterior Our example is covered in Copper colored paint that shows in used but presentable condition, meaning it has its share of chips, scratches, peeling, and surface rust. There's also some bubbling near the rocker panel. Overall however, the panels appear fairly straight with the color change the car is wearing from the original Medium Yellow Gold. The chrome bumpers are in decent condition as are the metal trimmings, including the window frame. The long hood leads into a shoulder line that rises on the rear quarter panel and terminates in a vertically flat tail. Distinctive taillights are flush with the rear panel and have the reverse light in the center of three segments. The 14-inch wheels with Sport wheelcovers along with the white lined tires that surround them keep this skate on the road. The black canvas top seems to be in outstanding condition and retains a glass rear window. Interior Ginger is the original interior color code, but it's not ginger in 2024 terms, meaning orange. It's ginger that's more of a saddle brown with tinges of yellow. The driver's door panel starts the palette and surrounds a faux wood panel. This particular door shows some age and will benefit from cleaning and restoration, while the passenger door is in better shape. Meanwhile, the panel of electric window switches on the driver's door is impressive. Moving onto the seats, the vinyl bolster and side supports surround a knit center and the front buckets along with the rear bench are in good condition while the molded plastic interior trim could use a good cleaning or repainting. A very basic but matching steering wheel indicates the Mustang's less sporty nature which is also relayed by the simple dash with minimal features. The center stack redeems the car with a trio of round gauges, an AM/FM radio, theheater/AC controls. A clock fits into the center console ahead of the familiar Ford shifter. The ginger loop style carpet is consistent with the condition of the car which is intact but showing some age. The trunk is bare metal and houses a steel wheeled spare tire. The paint on the underside of the trunk lid is noticeably decent. Drivetrain Combustion chamber design and intake differentiate the 351ci Cleveland rated at 240 horsepower. A 2-barrel carburetor feeds it fuel while a FMX 3-speed automatic transmission sends power to the 9 rear with 3.00 TracLok gearing. Power brakes, disc in front, drums in the back, equip this car. Visually, the engine bay is driver quality but clean, the Ford blue valve covers shining through and the decals on the blue air filter housing is clean and readable. Undercarriage Generally clean and dry underneath with minimal areas of surface rust. We do see a bit of oil near the rear differential which looks to be the pinion seal. There's some on the frame rails on the front but none on the oil pan. A single exhaust intersects a Flowmaster muffler and then continues to exit out back. It's covered in surface rust, but the gas tank is clean and shiny. Independent, coil spring suspension is found in the front and leaf springs in the rear. Drive-Ability A tickle of the gas pedal and a turn of the key and we were off to the test loop. 240 horsepower is buffered by the 2-barrel, but eventually the car gets up to speed and runs smoothly. Power brakes work just fine and on our list of misses, only the A/C is noted as non functional. 1971-1973 Mustangs in base trim levels have not had their day in the sun yet, but it's bound to happen based on this period's Mach 1's rise in valuation. And speaking of sun, here's a rare convertible from 1971 with all the bones of a restorable classic car.

It had a Ram Air Shaker hood scoop, special striping, and the new-for-'69 styling and was an aggressive car with performance to back up that image. The 428 Super Cobra Jet was developed by Ford's Light Vehicle Powertrain Department and it made the 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1 one of the world's fastest cars and was certainly one of the fastest factory stock cars you could own on the street! This 1969 428 Super Cobra Jet we have at Skyway Classics has been correctly restored where needed all the right parts, and is not only a serious investment grade classic, but a very fast and fun driver.

Mechanical Ours Cobra Jet 428 has the vaunted optional R-Code Ram Air 428 cubic inch engine with a 4-barrel that was modestly rated at 335 horsepower @ 5,200 440 lb\u00b7ft @ 3,400 rpm. The 428 CJ's actual power output is reputed to be well north of 400 horse, with its advertised numbers artificially lowered to help keep the insurance companies from jacking up its rates.. At the top of the engine, a Holley 4-barrel carburetor sits under a correct ram air induction system which draws fresh air from the detailed shaker scoop. Other components include silver finned valve covers, cast iron manifolds, a high-performance exhaust system, fresh hoses and correct clamps. The CJ spotless engine bay has the correct satin black paint and all of the correct components look fresh from the shock tower brace to the correct decals, vacuum hoses and accessory brackets are there. From the factory, the 428 CJ was treated to a set of deep-breathing heads from the 427 (2.09/1.65-inch valves, combustion chamber volumes between 73 and 75 cc, larger intake and exhaust ports, 427 valve springs and dampers), a 735-cfm Holley four-barrel carb, and freer-breathing exhaust manifolds, along with beefier connecting rods. The rest of this Ford has been restored to the same high standards as its exterior and engine compartment. It has a C6 automatic transmission and a durable Ford 9-inch rear end with the 3.50 Traction Lock. All that power hits the pavement with 14-inch factory 5-spoke factory styled mag wheels and a set of BF Goodrich Radial TA tires. Even with the automatic transmission, in 1969, Car Life magazine's CJ Mach 1 took just 5.5 seconds 0-60 mph and flew through the standing 1/4 in 13.90 seconds at 103.32 mph. 'The best Mustang yet and quickest ever,' said the editors, who also declared it 'the quickest standard passenger car through the quarter-mile we've ever tested (sports cars and hot rods excluded).' Interior The interior features the black vinyl with Hi-Back buckets seats with the dash that has working gauges which include a factory clock, and features wood grain trim.

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1966 Ford Mustang\nThis 1966 Ford Mustang Convertible is a sporty little summer cruiser loaded with fantastic options! Coming out of the 1950s and into the early 1960s, there was a gap in the American automotive market; there were no cool compact cars. Under the direction of famed Ford executive Lee Iacocca, the Ford Motor Company sought to fill that gap and that's exactly what Ford did on April 17, 1964, when the Mustang was introduced at the New York World's Fair. The initial vision for the new Mustang was a sporty, youth oriented car with a long hood, short deck, and a modest price tag. While the first-year Mustangs sold extremely well, with Ford producing over 125,000 units, no one could have guessed that Mustang would ultimately snowball into one of the most successful Ford vehicles of all time and launch an entire new genre of muscle cars known as Pony Cars. In its second year, and the first full year of production, Ford would go on to produce nearly 600,000 Mustangs so by 1966, Ford was not going to mess with what was working for them in the Mustang and in turn the '66 Mustang was similar to the '65 version. In fact, Ford's advertising promoted the 1966 Mustang with the tag line Relax Mustang lovers. Your favorite car hasn't changed much in 1966. The most apparent upgrade made to the 1966 Mustang was the addition of a newly redesigned grille, shifting away from the '65 honeycomb style to the horizontal bar, floating Mustang look. The interiors were also updated a bit, most notably, the 1966 Mustang received a brand new 5 pot instrument cluster treatment that gave the new Mustang more of a race car look and feel. With these minor stylistic changes, the Mustang continued to be a massively successful vehicle for the Ford Motor Company with the Mustang commanding a 7.1% market share for overall US automobile sale and being said that over 1.25 million Mustangs were on the roads by the end of 1966. This particular Mustang Convertible comes to us from long term single family ownership who did a wonderful job as stewards of this classic Pony Car. Powering this '66 Mustang Convertible is a 289 Cubic Inch V8 engine fed by a single 4 barrel carburetor that together were said to have produced 225 horsepower when new. The A-Code 289 V8 is backed by an Automatic transmission that makes this '66 Mustang an easy car for anybody to take for a spin around the block. Exhaust exits the Ford powerplant via a dual exhaust setup that generates a terrific throaty sound out of the rear tailpipes. This 1966 Ford Mustang comes loaded with options! With power steering, maneuvering in and out of a tight parking space at the local car show or ice cream parlor is a total breeze and the overall driving experience is much improved. The white vinyl power convertible top is in wonderful condition and it goes up and down with the simple flick of a switch. Additionally, when the power top is in the down position, it tucks neatly underneath a red boot cover. Riding on a set of whitewall radial tires, each paired with a full wheelcover, this 1966 Mustang has a fantastic look and an even better ride cruising down the road. The exterior of this Mustang Convertible has been correctly refinished in Candy Apple Red paint that completes the gorgeous exterior look of this Pony Car. The interior of this 1966 Ford Mustang Convertible is dazzling! The front bucket seats and rear bench seat have been correctly reupholstered in Red vinyl with the correct Deluxe Pony inserts. The woodgrain steering wheel, red upholstered door panels, red carpeting, and red padded dash are all in fantastic condition and all appear to retain their nice stock appearance. The instrument cluster is equipped with a 140 MPH speedometer, amp gauge, temperature gauge, oil pressure gauge, and fuel gauge. The dash is finished off with an upgraded Mustang-branded AM/FM/Cassette entertainment system and woodgrain-trimmed glovebox.

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1972 Chevrolet Camaro\n1972 Chevrolet Camaro SS396 1972 represented a fairly substantial year in the Camaro world. With impending emission and safety regulations looming, not to mention a rise in gas prices, discussion of the F-body being on the chopping block was circulating. With morale low and a future unknown, 1972 would be the last year for the SS model, speedometers would be reduced from 150 to 130, and the partnership with Hurst shifters would end. For consignment, a 1972 Chevrolet Camaro SS396, a true LS3 U code car that is one of just 970 produced in 1972. This one has been fitted with a Holley Sniper EFI system, an M22 Rock Crusher transmission, and some other performance enhancements. As we write this, the Camaro Nationals is a few weeks away from taking place here at Classic Auto Mall, so if you have interest in this car, do not hesitate to contact a Car Specialist before 1,000 Camaro enthusiasts descend on the mall. Exterior Looking at the 1972 Camaro sales brochure, Mojave Gold was used for the SS press car and that's what we have on this car, this one featuring a cowl hood, solid bumper, and an SS emblem on the grille that became coarser in 1972. A three piece sharply angled rear spoiler was standard on the SS and so was dual exhaust which we see represented by straight tailpipes under the rear valance. Contrasting black paint fills the rear fascia around the ultra cool quad taillights and license plate cutout. The smooth profile is uninterrupted by side molding but does wear an SS396 fender badge. 15-inch SS Sport wheels are wrapped in staggered size tires for an extra muscular stance. Chrome and polished metal elements of the car are in great shape and so is the paint with the exception of some small areas of bondo repair and paint drips. Most panel gaps are good with a few that are less than perfect. Interior This car now sports a black interior that starts with clean and unmarred plastic and vinyl door panels with an armrest between two storage pockets. Tall sport bucket seats in a stitch patterned and buttoned design are firmly shaped and showing no wear and the back 2+2 seats repeat the pattern and condition. A standard steering wheel features an SS emblem and leads to the dashboard that's fronted by the Holley Sniper screen. Behind that screen are the six standard gauges including a tachometer in a textured plastic dash panel. Climate controls are to the left and show a bit of patina and in center is an AM radio looking very period at a time when even rock stations were on AM. In the center console emerges the shifter and more molded plastic construction leading to a storage bin between the seats. Loop carpet in black covers the floor with a set of SS carpeted mats on top and the glossy vinyl headliner is in fine condition. The trunk is covered with a plaid vinyl mat. Drivetrain Under the hood is a very clean and very large 402ci motor date coded to 1971 and topped by a Holley Sniper EFI system, all backed by a 1970 vintage Muncie M22 4-speed manual transmission that sends the horsepower to the rear 10 bolt with 2.56 gears. Power brakes are supplied with discs in front and drums in the rear. Undercarriage Relatively clean with driver quality conditions underneath with surface rust coating the driveshaft, headers, and other parts. It's not dirty and there are no oil leaks visible, only some residual oil on the oil pan. The dual exhaust encounters a pair of Flowmaster mufflers and then exits out back. Suspension consists of coil springs up front and mono leaf springs with CalTrac bars out back. Drive-Ability No need to pump the gas here as the EFI system delivers fuel with the turn of the key and the info screen lights up like a Christmas tree. The 402 roars to life and we roll this gold F-body onto the loop where we find power on tap and a sure footed ride in a comfortable cabin. Most items work as intended with the exception of the horn, the reverse lights, the speedometer, and the odometer. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. Even with the modifications, this is still one of 970 1972 Camaro SS396 cars. Options for buyers may include leaving it as is and enjoying the electronic Holley system for reliable starts and fuel management or seek out a 1972 era 396 and reconfigure things to stock specifications. Either way, you'll have a rare car, a good runner, and an attractive F-body with which to enjoy the open road! 1Q87U2N165237 1-Chevrolet Q-Camaro 87-2 Door Hardtop Sport Coupe U-396ci 4bbl 240hp LS3 V8 2-1972 N-Norwood, OH Assy Plant 165237-Sequential Unit Number TRIM TAG ST 72 12387-1972 Camaro 2 Door Hardtop Sport Coupe BDY N2317142-Norwood Body # TR 778-Tan Standard Vinyl Buckets PNT 63 63-Mohave Gold 03D-4th Week March A51-Bucket Seats Z27-Super Sport Package LS3-396ci 240hp Turbofire V8, SS Classic Auto Mall is home to more than 1,000 classic and collectible vehicles for sale via consignment in a climate controlled 336,000-square foot showroom (that's more than 8 acres!).

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1967 Chevrolet Camaro\n1967 Chevrolet Camaro Coupe The first-generation Chevrolet Camaro appeared in Chevrolet dealerships in September 1966 for the 1967 model year on a brand-new rear-wheel drive GM F-body platform and was available as a 2-door, 2 plus 2 seat, hardtop, (no B or center pillar), or convertible, with the choice of either a straight-six or V8 engine. The first-generation Camaro was built through the 1969 model year. This 67 as we can see, had undergone a recent restoration with some major changes to the original configuration of the power plant. The body and frame have been kept OEM. Bought from the keyboardist for Bon Jovi, David Bryan, it has a little provenance, and a lot of power. Exterior Marina Blue respray of 3 coats base and 3 coats clear, and it shines like a crazy diamond. Very nice paint, complete with the wrap around front hood stripe in white and SS badge. This car also carries the RS package, consisting of hidden headlights that work perfectly and RS specific taillight bezels, (the all-important Z22 RPO code). Rocker chrome, and wheel well surround trim is excellent. Small bumpers are also excellent. A white hardtop draped with vinyl is blemish free and tops this Mustang eater off perfectly. On all 4 corners are stock blue steel wheels with dog dish caps, wrapped by black sidewall tires, correct for the period but updated. Also need to mention the small but sexy rear spoiler floating above the trunk, (actually its attached). Interior I'm breaking protocol and starting with the trunk which you have to see to believe. All wrapped in green and black houndstooth vinyl it contains the spare, (wrapped in the houndstooth vinyl), a wheeled jack, and crowbar neatly displayed within the houndstooth. Now we can move to the meat and potatoes of the interior...the passenger compartment. Swinging the doors, we are greeted with excellence. Excellent door panels in blue, excellent buckets in blue vinyl with some snazzy white stripe highlights bordering the bolsters and flanking a dual cupholder. This rests on the black textured console which houses the Hurst shifter. As we move to the dash there are 3 aftermarket gauges hanging below the dash, and in front of the shifter. These monitor oil, volts, and water temp. Moving up the angled inward dash in blue, there are a few chromed knobs and dual deep dish round gauges framed by an original steering wheel, all just in peachy condition (actually they are blue and black). Noted on the original steering column is a tachometer so you can avoid the red zone. Beautiful carpet below, and a tight headliner above and we have covered the interior. Drivetrain Take a deep breath, here we go! The original numbers matching block and crankshaft were utilized, but inside were placed KB hypereutectic .020 pistons and rings with a 9.5 to 1 compression, Scat rods, a polished and balanced crank. Aluminum heads are attached with titanium seats stainless valves, and .500 lift springs. A Comp Thumper Cam with .491 int, and .491 exhaust lift, is of the hydraulic variety, Howard lifters, roller rockers, and sealed with all Fel-Pro gaskets. Topping it off is a Quickfuel 650 CFM carburetor, and Edelbrock intake manifold. This 350ci mill exhales through Hedman Headers and a Flowmaster exhaust. Transmission is a 4-speed manual Muncie, (1969 vintage), and the rear is a 12 bolt 3.73 posi edition. Whew! Undercarriage Visually edible, (aka eye candy), near perfect, and well taken care of on any rust fronts because it does not exist...anywhere! Solid as a rock. 4 Wheel 9 drum brakes non power assisted are installed. Drive-Ability Lights quickly, and just listening to the exhaust sound of the idle, you know you are in for a ride. This car does not disappoint, as it runs like a deer, stings like a bee, and handles like a butterfly, all while looking great and turning heads. It has to be a female car, because it can do more than one thing at once...but I digress, and back to the wonderful handling, ride, and acceleration. She is just a great driver whose power goes on longer than our test area. And the color...deeper than your eyes can see. Kudos to the restorers...with an excellent example of the Camaro 350 SS coupe, as it has no stones unturned, plenty of power, and great looks interior and exterior. She's a multitasker, and a cool driver right out of 1967, and she will eat a Mustang of the same era anytime. Oh Oh here she comes, she's a man eater!

Factory Wide Ratio 4spd Top loader Decor Interior Fold-Down Rear Seat Rebuilt Front Suspension & Steering Rebuilt Rear Suspension Factory Rear Sway Bar This '71 is a really cool time-capsule from the 80's. From the shadowed hand painted graphics to the super-sexy pinstripes you can feel just how cool this one was on Saturday nights with some Billy Squier 'Stroke' playing on the Hi-Fidelity stereo. Air shocks & N50's would have been a must, no longer there but you know they were. The 80's were the height of the 351 Cleveland reverence. Huge cylinder heads, high compression, big cams, way oversized header tubes and good gas still to be had at the pumps. Soon the 90's would come and kill most of the cruising and good fuel forcing these cars off the road. Originally bound for the Utah ordering district this Mach 1 spent its life in the dry regions. The floors are some of the nicest originals you will see in this breed. There is some minor rear wheel well rust to be found thanks to the rural nature of its home region, see pics. Overall all though this is a very solid example. Obviously the paint has some age to it with plenty of imperfections. There are no obvious signs of significant collision damage. You could easily drive this one as is or a repaint looks like a straight forward job thanks to an original metal body. Inside, the interior has seen some refreshing with new seat upholstery, carpet and dash pad upholstery. It really does look nice and shows very little wear. The 'Decor' interior was an option for '71 in the Mach 1's so many didn't come with it. Also optional is the factory gauge package with center stack gauges and a tachometer. This Mach 1 started life out as a well optioned boulevard bruiser. The M-Code 351 4-Barrel Cleveland was a well proven motor with potential well beyond most of its competitors. Add in that wide ratio 4-Speed and a 9' with 3.25 gearing. Category 1971_ford_mustang"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Price is $27995.00"}]}

Enterprises Auto Museum and Sales presents this 1969 CHEVROLET CAMARO SS 396/375 L-89 from the outstanding Jeff Mauk Collection of classic era Chevrolet muscle machines. This numbers matching 1969 Chevrolet Camaro SS was the recipient of a professional nut-and-bolt, rotisserie restoration to splendid condition and has been certified by Jerry MacNeish of Camaro Hi-Performance. This car is one of 311 L-89s produced for the year Original Vinyl Top Original Tinted Glass Original YJ coded rally wheels with beauty rings Original CH coded Harrision Radiator Sold New at Jack Maxton Chevrolet in Worthington Ohio Finished in an understated Frost Green metallic with black stripes, a black vinyl roof and a matching black interior, and powered by a 396 cubic inch aluminum V8 engine paired with a Turbo 400 automatic transmission. The car also incorporates Soft Ray-tinted glass, rechromed bumpers, a pushbutton AM/FM radio and, in place of the standard SS hood with chromed intake bezels, the optional ZL2 Special Ducted Hood. The L89 aluminum head big-block V-8 was one of the many powertrain option choices for the 1969 Camaro, but it was by far the rarest application. The L89 is endowed with 11 1 compression, as well as forged internals, a solid lifter cam, and an aluminum intake topped with a Holley 4-barrel. The high-flow aluminum heads are responsible for unleashing additional horsepower while saving weight (75 pounds) in the front end, which in turn improved front-rear weight distribution for NHRA Super Stock racing. SS features include power brakes with front discs, black lower sills, simulated rear fender lovers, hood insulation, hockey stick front fender stripes, special suspension, hood and trim, and Goodyear Polyglas white-letter tires on 14x7-inch Rally wheels. EXCELLENT CONDITION, Jerry MacNeish Certified, and a copy of the original title and a binder of documentation accompany this beautifully restored, L89-powered 1969 Camaro SS.

The original 390 block wasmissing, so the last owner decided to build something a little bit more extreme than the original 325hp 390. He located390 ''truck block'' from the mid-70s as they have thicker webbing and cylinder walls, and bought an eagle rotating assembly to get a 445ci displacement.

We can assist with financing and shipping as needed. If you are looking for a quality first-generation Mustang then this beautiful example might be your car. This restored 1966 A-code coupe captures all the excitement from almost 60 years ago when the Mustang forever changed the automotive landscape. It epitomizes the classic Mustang look with its timeless lines and one-year-only Emberglo paint, and it also offers a sporty ride with its V8 engine and 4-speed transmission. Built in January 1966, this Mustang underwent a restoration which included installation of GT equipment. The underside looks great with floors, frame sections, rockers, and torque boxes that are all solid and free of any rust problems. The body was repainted its original Emberglo which is a favorite among enthusiasts. The beautiful color is highlighted nicely by the GT striping and white sidewall tires. Other GT features include foglights and the special rear valence with trumpet exhaust tips. All the chrome and moldings were also replaced or reconditioned as were the lenses, emblems, and trim pieces. The classic styled steel wheels wear BF Goodrich Silvertown tires (6.95-14) from 2022. This is an A-code Mustang, meaning it came from the factory with a 4-barrel 289 cubic inch engine rated at 225 hp. Aftermarket equipment includes a Holley carburetor with electric choke and finned Cobra valve covers along with an aluminum radiator that has been painted black. It also has headers that feed Flowmaster mufflers which give this car a great sound which can be heard in the video. The 4-speed transmission has been upgraded with a Hurst shifter for better performance than the original Ford setup. The factory 8\u201d rear end has been swapped out in favor of a stronger 9\u201d assembly. Front disc brakes are present along with a dual reservoir master cylinder. Looking inside reveals a complete black Pony (Deluxe) interior. This is a nice upgrade over the standard version and includes embossed seat backs, molded door panels, carpeted kick panels, bright trimmed pedals, woodgrain dash inserts, and a wooden steering wheel. Other features on this example include a Rally Pac with working tachometer and clock along with a remote mirror on the driver\u2019s side. The only change from stock is a modern AM/FM digital radio that fits in the original dash opening. Everything is functional including the speedometer, fuel gauge, lights, turn signals, wipers, washers, horn, and heater/defroster. The trunk is nicely finished with a mat along with a matching spare tire cover and jack bag. This Mustang presents a very appealing package. It is a gorgeous car inside and out with great GT looks, but is also in turn-key condition with a V8 engine and 4-speed transmission. While this classic can be appreciated by any car collector, be prepared to draw attention from all types of people wherever you go.

The freedom and simplicity of an original Pony Car remind us why so many of us fell in love with the muscle car era in the first place. One look at this 1965 Ford Mustang Fastback, and it's easy to see why these cars were so popular. Starting with a blue exterior complemented by twin full-length white racing stripes, this car gets a GT350-style hood and front valance to go along with the GT350 side stripes and decals. A GT-style rear exhaust go right along with the grill-mounted fog lights to make this car look aggressive and complete from any angle. Inside, the nicely upholstered white vinyl interior features a round gauge package just aft of the three-spoke wooden rimmed steering wheel, which perfectly coordinates with the wood grain surrounding the gauge cluster and the glove box door. A retro-looking AM/FM digital stereo features a cassette player along with Mustang lettering to help it look like original equipment. Under that GT350-style hood sits a modified 1968-69 302 cubic-inch Windsor small-block featuring two-bolt mains. Trick Flow aluminum heads are protected by Ford Racing valve covers, while an Edelbrock single four-barrel carburetor breathes through a matching Edelbrock air cleaner to feed the beast, while long tube headers and glasspack mufflers allow it to exhale with authority.

GM only produced 8,733 Camaro Z28 models in 1970 and a very limited amount of those were Rally Sport Z28s. This car sports its original color combination of Camaro Gold with black Z28 stripes and black interior. With a factory LT-1 350/360hp V8 and 4-speed manual transmission this car rips!\u201d \u2013 Marc Schiliro This authentic 1970 Chevrolet Camaro RS Z28 is the product of a show quality restoration. It has been certified by Camaro expert Jerry MacNeish of Camaro Hi-Performance on March 24th, 2016. The report and Certificate of Authenticity are included. In 1970, the second generation Camaro was introduced and only 8,733 Z28 models were produced making this a rare and very collectable model. General Motors didn't keep records but it's believed a very limited amount was built with the Rally Sport package. As the NCRS Shipping Data Report documents this example was produced on April 1st, 1970 which was at the Norwood, Ohio factory. As the original factory window sticker documents this example is equipped with the following options (53-53) \u2013 Camaro Gold with black Z28 stripes, (711)- Black vinyl interior, (A01)- Soft-Ray tinted glass, (D35)- Sport mirrors, (G80)- 3.73 Positraction axle, (J50)- power brakes, (M21) \u2013 4-speed close-ratio manual transmission, (U14)- Special Instrumentation, (U63)- AM pushbutton radio, (U80)- rear seat speaker, (Z22)- Rally Sport equipment and (Z28)- Special Performance equipment. The original delivery dealer was Cunningham-Kelley Chevrolet located in Hartsville, Tennessee. From the information gathered this car was a southern car for over 40 years and retains its original sheet metal. Please note there is no supporting documentation to support that claim. The car was the product of a rotisserie restoration and is in show quality condition throughout. It was owned by Legendary Motor Cars in Canada and also by Jim Mattison of Pontiac Historic Services. MS CLASSIC CARS purchased the car in July of 2024 and January of 2025 is the first time it's been listed for sale. MS CLASSIC CARS invested a total of $11,293.98 in service and detail which is documented with an invoice. The exterior of this car presents very nicely throughout. It appears like a vehicle that was restored recently. The body is straight and the body panel fitment is very good including the hood. As noted above, from the information gathered this was a southern car and retains all its original sheet metal. During the restoration process the body was repainted in its original color of Camaro Gold with black Z28 stripes. This seldom seen color dresses the sporty factory design perfectly. The paint was recently detailed by the team at MS CLASSIC CARS to a brilliant shine. The paint is in overall excellent condition with very little imperfections. It retains all original factory Soft-Ray tinted glass which is in very good condition with only minor scratching. The front windshield and door stainless trim appears original. The front grille, headlight bezels, front bumpers, rear window stainless trim, rear tail light bezels and rear bumper appear to have been restored or replaced. It's been outfitted with the correct style Goodyear Polyglas GT F60-15 tires that were added by MS CLASSIC CARS. Everything on the exterior such as the windshield wipers, headlights, parking lights, turn signals, brake lights and reverse lights are in working order. The interior of this car is finished in its original black color which complements the exterior perfectly. It appears that everything has been restored or replaced such as the headliner, dash pad, dash woodgrain trim, gauges, steering wheel, door panels, seats and carpeting. It retains the original factory seat belts. MS CLASSIC CARS added a new console which looks beautiful. It was outfitted with the correct style matching black rubber mats. Everything in the interior is in working order such as the interior lights, gauges, clock, radio, key buzzer and heating system. The trunk compartment was restored and refinished in gray. It's equipped with a full size spare and tools. The engine compartment is nicely detailed throughout with many correct parts. It retains the original trim tag. The firewall, inner fenders and radiator support were refinished in the correct shade of black. It was decorated with factory assembly marks throughout. The car is powered by a date code LT-1 350 V8 that was factory rated with 360 horsepower. As the \u201c010\u201d casted block with \u201cC210\u201d cased dates indicate this engine was built on March 21st, 1970 which is 11 days before the car was built. Although the engine was re-stamped, it's possible the engine was the original engine to the car and during the machining process the original stamp was damaged which was common. Either way it's as date code correct as you'll ever find for a re-stamped block. The engine was completely rebuilt and runs excellent. The engine is equipped with the correct stamped intake, smog, finned valve covers and correct style air cleaner. The engine breathes through manifolds and a correct style dual exhaust system with single muffler that was replaced new. The engine is coupled to a correct \u201c661\u201d case Muncie M21 4-speed manual transmission. The transmission was re-stamped with the dates of March 02, 1970. The transmission was rebuilt and shifts precisely through the gears. The power is transferred to a date code 12-bolt rear axle with 4.10 gears. The axle casting date is April 14th, 1970 which is 13 days after the car was built. The car was originally built with 3.73 positraction rear axle. The undercarriage is also nicely detailed throughout with many correct parts. The original floors were restored and paint in red oxide primer. The fuel system, power steering system, suspension components and braking system has been all gone through. MS CLASSIC CARS completely redid the entire braking system as indicated on the invoice. This car runs and drives awesome! Category 1970_chevrolet_camaro"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Price is $109900.00"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You estimate prices of items. Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1970 Ford Mustang\nThe Boss 429, sometimes referred to as the Boss 9 by blue oval enthusiasts, is arguably one of the rarest and most valued muscle cars from the era. In total, there were 859 original '69 Boss 429s and only 499 for the 1970 model year. The origin of the Boss 429 was as a result of Ford's desire to compete in NASCAR. Ford was seeking to develop a Hemi engine that could take on the Mopar Hemi boys the 426 Hemi Charger Daytona and Plymouth Superbirds, the monsters Ford wanted to slay to achieve its desire to rule the track. NASCAR required that at least 500 cars be fitted with the competition motor and sold to the general public for homologation purposes. The Boss 429 engine featured aluminum cylinder heads, which had a modified Hemi-type combustion chamber, which Ford called crescent . The Boss 429 engine used a single 735 CFM Holley 4-barrel carburetor on an aluminum intake manifold. All these cars had the Hurst competition shifter and 4-speed manual transmissions, and the Boss was rated very conservatively at 375 HP, while actual output was believed to be well over 500 HP. Mustangs were simply too small to accept the massive Boss 429 engine, so Ford hired Kar Kraft of Brighton, Michigan, to modify existing 428 Cobra Jet and Super Cobra Jet Mach 1 Mustangs. Modifications included widening the shock towers and extending out the inner fenders. The mounts for the front suspension were chopped and displaced to create room for the block and exhaust manifolds. The battery was repositioned to the trunk, and a stiff .75-inch sway bar was added to the rear end to improve handling since the car was now nose heavy. It was also equipped with a 3.91-ratio rear axle with a Traction-Lok limited-slip differential. In addition, a hole was cut in the hood, and a manually controlled hood scoop was added. Other features included a front spoiler and color-keyed dual racing mirrors. While the Boss 429 was an unusual platform to build a road race car from, as the 429 engine is very heavy and leads to unequal weight distribution and poor handling characteristics, the extra power of the 429 helped make up for time in the straights. This Boss 429 was purchased new on January 7, 1970 at Jim Blackman Ford in Sebring, Florida. It was originally a Calypso Coral street car that was converted to race specs in 1974 by its first owner, Neil Potter. This is Orange Blossom III and is one of only two Boss 429s known to have been raced in the IMSA Camel GT series. It raced 1975-77 in events like the Sebring 12 Hours of Endurance and the 24 Hours of Daytona, and it competed with all the best sports cars of the period. Retired after the 1977 race season, the car was placed into a storage building at the Sebring race track. After a tornado in 1983, the car was moved from its track storage to Potter's barn, where it was disassembled for future restoration. In 1985, Potter finally sold his car and parts as a basket case to the second owner, who planned to do a complete the restoration. It passed to the cars third owner in 1990, still in unrestored condition. A complete restoration began in 2005 and required extensive sheet metal repair. The comprehensive rotisserie restoration was completed in 2009, and the car was subsequently shown at the Mid America Shelby meet that same year, where it was awarded first in its class and listed in the Boss 429 registry.

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1967 Chevrolet Camaro\nFollowing the tremendous success of the Ford Mustang, executives at General Motors moved quickly to develop their own sporty pony car to rival the Mustang on the sales floor, racetrack, and drag strip. At that point, the innovative Corvair was struggling with declining sales due to negative publicity, prompting Chevrolet to introduce a new yet conventional car to fill that market segment. The 1967 Camaro made its debut in September, giving GM enthusiasts a mid-size sporty vehicle to take pride in. Similar to the competition from Dearborn, the Camaro boasted a variety of engine options, ranging from the economical 230 cubic inch inline six to the formidable 396 cubic inch big block. Like its counterpart from Ford, the Chevrolet Camaro remains a cornerstone of the collector car community, with extensive aftermarket support and a passionate fan base worldwide. This 1967 Chevrolet Camaro features a 350 Chevy Small Block engine under the hood. Its impressive power is further amplified by a four-barrel carburetor that delivers instant acceleration for an exhilarating driving experience. The engine is ideally matched with a three-speed automatic transmission. The white exterior paint shines beautifully on this vehicle. The body is well-defined, with straight panels and consistent, factory-appropriate gaps. Inside, the pristine condition of the black vinyl is immediately noticeable, harmonizing perfectly with the exterior color. The door panels are in excellent shape, complementing the matching black carpet. Additionally, the car features a stunning new gauge cluster. The 1967 Chevrolet Camaro stands as a classic muscle car, embodying the pinnacle of power and style from the golden age of American automobiles. With its bold design and robust engine, this iconic Camaro commands attention on the road and is a true masterpiece for any serious collector.

This vehicle is available for viewing by appointment only. Please call us to schedule an appointment. 1968 is a cool year for the Ford Mustang for a lot of reasons. It is the last year of this body style. It is considered by many to be the last of the Pony Cars, as in 1969 they went to a more muscle car styling. It is the first year of the now infamous 302 CID V8, and it was used for the Bullitt Mustang, which is iconic! There were two 302 options in 1968, and this one has the higher horsepower J-Code, rated at 230 horsepower. That is a horsepower number that wouldn't be passed by a 302 powered Mustang until 2011 with the release of the Coyote 5.0! (this excludes Boss 302 and SVT offerings) This example is show quality throughout and has some rare features. It is just 1 of 46 Fastbacks made in Candyapple Red with a Dark Red interior. It is 1 of 1,690 Fastbacks with this DSO, and 1 of just 6,740 J-Codes built with a C4 automatic transmission! This Mustang has all the right things going for it. That engine is paired with power steering and power front disc brakes for a great driving experience. The exterior is gorgeous in the always popular Candyapple Red which has been matched with 15 Cragar SS wheels with radial tires on all four corners. It has a killer stance and a great sound from the dual exhaust to match! The interior is incredibly clean throughout and ready to show. The bucket seats are wrapped in comfort weave Dark Red vinyl upholstery, as they were from the factory. Round gauges, floor shifter, and fold down rear seat complete the interior in style. The trunk and engine compartment are also highly detailed and ready to present at shows. The underside is clean and solid and presents well with dual exhaust and front disc brakes.

This car has resided in the Los Angeles area its entire life and is 100% original rust free body. Never any rust repair. You can still see the factory red primer on the underside of the floor pans and many of the assembly line markings (see photos). It's an extremely loaded optioned car that quite original, unlike many cars you will find. Approximately 50% of the paint is still original and has shine, but not show quality. There are a few scratches, chips and small dings. It came off the assembly line with all of the options you see, including black vinyl top (extremely nice unripped, unfaded condition), deluxe interior, console, power steering, disc brakes factory A/C and tinted glass. Only two options it dis not come with was the premium 289 engine and deluxe am/fm or am 8-track radios. All the date codes on the body panels and glass are in line with the production date of the car. (Drivers door and windshield replaced). Small tear in the stitching of drivers seat and a few inches of headliner. I chose to leave these since it is so tough to find original interior pieces even in this condition. When you start adding up the expense to add these options to another car and the time it may take to hunt them down, you'll find the car has a lot of value. Car runs beautifully and is aggressive with its stock 289 2v engine. Auto trans. Tires and wheels are fairly new. I have a stack of original documentation of the car including the original owners manual, service records and CA registration certs back to the 80's that go with the car.

Ads of the day touted Mother warned me that there would be men like you driving cars like that. Do you really think you can snag me with that long low touch machine you just rolled up in? Dodge Charger RT with some SE trimmings sounds like Alphabet soup, and frankly I'm attracted to you because you have a very intelligent face...My name is Julia and here's my number! Offered for consignment and your viewing pleasure, showing 55,672 non verifiable miles, the epitome of what a Dodge muscle car from 1970 should be covered headlamps in an inset grille, the flying buttress rear window treatment, swelling fenders on a two door platform and power to match its visual presentation. That usually means a Hemi engine, but instead of the OEM 426 factory mill, this car is equipped with a 472ci 575hp version topped with Indy aluminum heads and ceramic polished headers with electric exhaust cutouts. Unlike the factory release, this engine is even equipped with Vintage Air, power steering, power brakes, as well as MSD ignition parts, serpentine belt front accessories and an aluminum radiator. That power is backed by an 18 spline A833 4-speed transmission with overdrive. Inside is a Legendary SE level interior appointment done in white materials, a center console with Pistol Grip floor shift, wood grain trim, a Tic-Toc-Tach and 150 MPH speedometer, 3 spoke sport steering wheel and R/T trim mats and dash logos. Outside, this car is covered in a variation of FJ5 Sublime by Michael's Custom Paint, with HEMI hood blackouts using silver lettering, a white vinyl top, chrome exhaust tips, dual body color mirrors, R/T door scoops and emblems, and the white scat stripe around the rear. Riding on a set of 5 spoke styled road wheels and modern BF Goodrich Radial T/A tires, this Dodge Charger is ready for you to turn the key and smoke the competition on the show field as well as at the stop light drags. Exterior Bumpers have been rechromed and all trim has been polished to look like new, so on the bling side of this car we are fully covered. All this is attached to straight steel panels all reworked to perfection then bathed in Sublime Green paint, which shows with nary a flaw. Also adorned with the original factory style sticker in white, the rear is wrapped with the wide white band and RT callouts show their faces on the added door scoops. Large flying buttress styled B pillars swoop rearward, framing the rear glass which tilts at a lesser angle than the pillars and give the back of the roof the inset look. Upfront the correct hidden badged R/T headlight panels are in a 3 segment grille with surrounding trimmings and one of those shiny dipped bumpers below. A body matching side view mirror hangs from either door, and on the driver's side is a large hinged fill cap on the top of the rear quarter. Not to be left out is the expansive roof, now covered in a perfectly complimenting white vinyl roof. BF Goodrich supplies the rubber which wraps the Mopar Road wheels rims on all 4 corners. I'll call this car anything but subliminal...read on kids for further explanation. InteriorThe interior seats have been reupholstered with parchment white vinyl all to original factory specs thanks to a SE kit from Legendary Upholstery, they look brand new. Front buckets in high back form, complete with some puffy tuck and roll inserts and smooth bolsters show as nearly new and the rear bench follows suit. Door panels are also white, very clean and all correct circular machined stainless Charger badge on the sills. A true to original wood wrapped steering wheel has the Fratzog corporate emblem central button. The factory gauge cluster lines up for you on the back dash front, and all spit shined and gleaming dials and knobs are present and accounted for upfront. A real wood pistol grip handle shift lever is in the center of the restored console, with the factory mac tacmaterial. Mounted in dash central is the factory AM radio hovering just below the slides for the heater/AC. Black carpet floods the floors and has fitted Charger R/T floor mats embroidered in a snappy red colorway. Pure crisp perfection ladies and gentlemen. Drivetrain Under the hood is certainly sublime, not only in color but in the fact that resting between the fenders is a potent mill that can destroy anything that comes its way. A 472ci Hemi V8 sporting an aftermarket block,hows that for some piston packing prowess? Oh, how about a pair of Indy aluminum cylinder heads for good measure along with an aluminum dual 4-barrel intake topped off with a factory style air cleaner assembly and wrinkle finish valve covers. Other neat-o features are a full MSD ignition, an Afco 4 core aluminum radiator with dual electric fans, March Enterprise serpentine pulley setup and full length headers and FlowMaster exhaust with factory style chrome tips. On the back is a 4-speed manual transmission designated A833 along with an overdrive unit, and way back a 8 3/4 rear axle. Undercarriage Done just right baby bear, all evenly Sublime coated, and tight as a drum on the structural side of things. An upgradedblowproof bellhousing is on to accommodate the bit of extra power from those 472 cubes, and to bring her to a stop are power from disc and power rear drum brakes. Torsion bars provide the front suspension ride and leaf springs are on the rear making for a comfortable ride that allows the drivetrain to put power to the ground. Drive-Ability The horsepower specs are all in the description, but we had to see for ourselves, so our resident muscle car shade tree mechanic and decoder expert took her for a spin. Everything was working perfectly save for the AC not blowing cold and his only comment when returning was This car is one bad mu*#er Fu*@er! . While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. A Charger R/T tribute and then some touched by the hands of a passionate restorer who has a need for speed and penchant for power.

The 1969 Mustang Mach I was such a hit that Ford discontinued the GT that year. In 1970, Mustangs received a facelift that became a one year design. For consignment, a 1970 Ford Mustang Mach I with a massaged 351ci V8 engine, Tremec transmission and a Marti report. It's a stunning car and while we can never predict how long a car will be in our Hallowed Halls, we think this one might be whisked away at the speed of sound. Exterior There are few birds as deeply black as a raven, and this car wears Raven Black in spectacular fashion. Mach 1's always have some black accents including the hexagon clad tail piece, wing, and shaker top and while it contrasts with other colors, they blend beautifully with our black car. A charcoal hood stripe is coordinated with a tail accent where Mach I is displayed in the center. For 1970, single headlights are flanked by open fins, unmistakable and a favorite of some, and with the recent passing of Parnelli Jones, his 1970 racer is all over the internet and bound to renew interest. And it's hard not to be interested in this black beauty, wearing 17-inch polished American Racing Torque Thrust wheels with staggered sized 40 series tires and sporting the only roof available for the Mach I, the fastback, or as it was called in '69 and '70, the SportsRoof. Dual exhaust tips protrude out the back and having been all the way around the car, we could not find any flaws to point out. Interior In 1970, Ford switched from dark walnut woodgrain trim to dark teak trim and the two are so close, it's often hard to distinguish. But the woodgrain panel is a highlight on the door panels which also include smoothly sculpted plastic and a carpeted lower, all picking up the black grains of the wood. Tall front bucket seats are in great shape with tuck and roll inserts with a weave pattern adding to the texture complexity. Rear 2+2 seats are smaller buckets with the same pattern and the sidewalls and rear shelf are unmarked and clean. A tongue and groove wood steering wheel presents to the pilot with three sport spokes connecting to a Mustang branded center cap. The faux woodgrain gauge pod contains four circles of instrumentation, and an extra temperature gauge has been added below the dash. A gaping center section is seamless and smooth and tops an aftermarket AM/FM/CD player with AUX and USB capabilities under which we find the climate controls. A clock and Mach I plate are housed in another faux woodgrain panel in front of the passenger while a Hurst T-handle shifter is in the center console which also is home to some woodgrain features. Black loop carpet adorns the floor in good condition and the black stitched headliner is unblemished. The trunk is lined in black carpeted pieces, and a few will need to be reattached in the otherwise clean trunk. Drivetrain Opening the hood, we find the shaker top over the air cleaner, a period appearing battery, and Cobra embossed valve covers. This is a 351ci Windsor V8 with a Comp cams .493i/500e lift, 218i/224e duration @ .050 110 lobe separation. A Holley 650 cfm 4-barrel carburetor supplies the fuel, and a 5-speed manual transmission is underfoot. That transmission is a Tremec TKO600 with an upgraded 31 spline output, 26 spline input, bronze shift fork pads, internal shift linkage upgrade, and Liberty threaded front cluster bearing support. Power is sent to the back wheels and a Ford 9 rear with 3.00 gears. Headers lead off the exhaust system and power brakes, disc front, drums rear, bring forward momentum to a stop. Undercarriage Other than some road spray and the occasional spot of surface rust, the underside is clean and dry. The dual exhaust enters a pair of FlowMaster mufflers before exiting under the bumper. Coil spring suspension is used up front and leaf springs in the back. Minimal grease buildup around the grease fittings but otherwise hardware is free and clear of debris. Drive-Ability She fired right up with a mighty roar and smoothly shifted into gear with plenty of power at your beck and call, we slowly rolled it around the test loop to find every function working properly save for the heater blower that didn't blow on the low speed setting. The interior is clean and comfortable and aside from that modern radio, is a time capsule to 1970. An ecology professor once told me ravens are the only bird that uses flight for fun, while other birds use it for getting from point A to point B. The Mach I is like a raven, capable of getting from point to point, but better used for fun. A stunning car with a one year only design in a desirable color.

But, we give the honors to the Charger for several reasons. First, the Corvette, being a smaller car in both seating capacity and wheelbase, has a much easier time attaining the desired sporty image. Second, Dodge stylists have shown that they can create a car in the current idiom with originality, combining just the right amount of tasteful conformity with that novelty and freshness which attracts attention. From Car and Driver's review of a '68 Charger, published November, 1967. For consignment, a 1968 Dodge Charger R/T hardtop, a highly optioned true J-code Hemi car in a metallic version of L-code Medium Dark Turquoise paint. 17,584 R/T models were built in 1968 and added more than $400 to the price of a Charger, about $3,600 in today's money! But only 475 of them received the Hemi, just 0.5% of Charger production. Exterior The genius design of the Mopar B-body is properly expressed in this generation of Charger with its long body panels, flat horizontal planes, sweeping C-pillar and the stupendous flying buttresses that flow off the rear window like tail of an F-15 jet. The one year only tail treatment of the car screams muscle car and pulls in more jet inference with quad tail lights that halo around dark holes in the center on a textbook square rear fascia over dual exhaust tips positioned perfectly under the car. Body lines on the door suggest forward movement and they repeat on the hood with turn indicators baked in. The hidden headlights flanking the vertical grille lack any disturbance of a midrib that would alter the '69 and '70 and the front fenders sport one year circular side markers. Body keyed 15-inch steel wheels are wrapped in red line tires and the vinyl top is done in white which as we'll see, matches the interior. Imperfections include a scuff on the left front fender, filler on the right, minor scratches, minor bubbles, and some waviness or depression to the vinyl top. Interior White vinyl door cards are topped with a header that is more ivory, underscored by a polished trim piece over an armrest that shows some patina on the driver's side. White bucket seats with sectional pleats also wear head restraints which have a classic 60's design in their simplicity. Dorchester grained vinyl continues on the back where the seats, armrests, and horizontal surface of the sidewalls show some patina. A brown plastic steering wheels tops a column that tracks down to the dashboard which with off center gauges and a combo clock/tachometer, (optional), on ribbed black plastic, while toggles for the vent controls are mounted on the bottom surface of the dash pad, just over the optional Music Master AM radio. The ribbing theme continues on the center console and takes on a more metallic profile and houses a curved chrome shifter with thumb button actuation. Black loop carpet covers the floor along with some carpeted mats and the white perforated headliner holds tight to the shoulder belts clipped to the outside edges, and we note some separation of the headliner back at the C-pillar. Drivetrain All Hail! The non-original, but date correct 426ci Hemi V8 under the hood, it all its gleaming goodness, rated at 425 horsepower and sucking fuel through dual 4-barrel carburetors. Miles per gallon? Who cares when you're counting smiles per gallon?! The bay is spotless and period correct, backed by a date correct A727 Torqueflite 3-speed automatic transmission sending hundreds of horses to the 8 \ufffd inch rear and 3.23 gears. Power brakes are needed to rein in those ponies and are configured as optional front discs and standard rear drums. Undercarriage Very clean underneath with surface rust appearing only on a section of frame where paint has been scraped and some suspicious brazing on the outer rear of the left front unibody rail. A few drops of oil on the pan but otherwise the underside is dry and free of debris. The dual exhaust meets an H-pipe, (as in Hemi!), then to FlowMaster mufflers and finally to resonators in the back just before the squarish chrome tips put on a trumpet show out back. Torsion bar suspension is up front and leaf springs in the back. Drive-Ability Another day, another legend here at Classic Auto Mall. The hemispherical beast lights up and lets out a roar, muted a bit by those resonators, and we stealthily find our way onto the test loop. There's obvious power on hand and straight tracking and braking is on point. Really no complaints here and all functional items worked as expected. While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. We have a red carpet at the entrance of Classic Auto Mall, pre rolled out for your arrival. This is a special car for the discerning buyer and whether you're a Mopar fanatic, muscle car aficionado, or collector of turquoise cars from the 60's, this rare B-body will likely find a new home with tirespinning quickness.

It was introduced in the spring of 1970. When Car & Driver Magazine tested a small block one in May of 1971 they stated, It's a Camaro like none before. It was longer, lower, and wider than the first generation Camaro. GM engineers have said the second generation is much more of A Driver's Car than its predecessor. The 1972 Chevrolet Camaro SS we have in stock at Adventure Classics is painted a bright white with black stripes, equipped with the split bumper front end that has become such a classic, has a date correct 350 cubic inch engine, Power Steering and Power Brakes, Air Conditioning, fat mag wheels and tires, automatic transmission, upgraded suspension system, and a white/black Houndstooth interior. 1972 Chevrolet Camaro SS Date Code Correct 350 cubic inch engine Performance carb Chrome open air cleaner Aluminum valve covers Tube headers Power Steering Power Brakes Air Conditioning Upgraded suspension system Automatic transmission Fat polished aluminum large mag wheels Black sidewall performance tires Dual exhaust system White/black Houndstooth interior Bucket seating Matching carpet Matching door panels Factory gauges and dash Updated Pioneer stereo radio system Wood steering wheel Factory center console with woodgrain trim White paint job Black racing stripes Chrome front and rear bumpers Full-width rear spoiler SS 350 emblems Mechanical Under the hood of our Camaro is the engine you should expect, a 350 cubic-inch V8 with a performance carb, chrome open air cleaner, aluminum valve covers, tube headers, Power Steering, Power Brakes, Air Conditioning, and upgraded suspension system. All this power is transmitted to the rear via an automatic transmission while riding on fat polished aluminum large mag wheels and black sidewall performance tires, with a dual exhaust system. Interior The interior is has looks better than original with the white/black Houndstooth interior, bucket seating with matching carpet, matching door panels, factory gauges and dash, updated Pioneer stereo radio system, wood steering wheel, and factory center console with woodgrain trim.

Reply only with the price, no explanation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much does this cost?\n\n1965 Ford Mustang\n1965 Ford Mustang T5 Hardtop The long awaited new sports car from Ford, the Mustang was introduced with much fanfare to the public in early April of 1964. The car featured innovative styling and was offered with several choices of engines, transmissions and options. The Mustang proved to be an instant success selling over 400,000 units the first year. Early in the production cycle Ford encountered a problem while trying to export Mustangs to Germany in the usual manner used with export vehicles. Ford solved this marketing dilemma the easiest way possible, they simply changed the name of all Mustangs exported to Germany to Ford T5 which had been used as the internal project code during development of Mustang. Sometime in the early 1950s a German truck manufacturer, Krupp, introduced a large general purpose truck and named it the Mustang. They were issued German copyrights to the name Mustang and continued to build this truck for many years. This truck was built in several configurations including a dump truck and a fire engine. This then was the situation with the name Mustang that Ford faced when they tried to sell their successful pony car in Germany. Rather than simply buying the name from Krupp for a reported $10,000 they chose instead to change the name of all Mustangs exported to Germany to Ford T5s. T5 has no specific meaning but it was the original project name for the Mustang in the early 1960's. For consignment, a mostly original car with light handed tasteful modifications to improve on the original. A 1965 289ci V8 C-code car with a newer mill is here for the taking and showing 4,169 non-verifiable miles on the odometer. In the early models, 65 and 66, several modifications were incorporated to change the car from a Mustang to a T5. The 65's received modified hub caps with a plain black center; both model years had the word Mustang removed from the horn ring, rear gas cap and a few other minor changes. Other than the branding, the mechanical changes to T5, as well as to Mustangs for other countries, were mostly limited to replacing the exterior lighting to meet European regulations, as well as some suspension tuning changes and installation of the shock tower brace from the Shelby GT350 to better suit continental roads. Ford did design new emblems for the front fender to designate the cars as T5s. Draped in a one year only hue of Silversmoke Gray, and a black standard interior, this well optioned car painstakingly restored and ready to gallop out of our Hallowed Halls and into your personal stable. We proudly offer you this 1st year pony from Ford, one of less than 340 T5 ponys to make its way back to US soil and number 13 in the T5 registry. Get ready to kick up some dust and fall in love with 1965 all over again. Exterior A beautiful Silversmoke Gray respray covers the exterior of this car and has some inclusions and scratches in a few areas but otherwise a very nice respray of the factory color. The restored metal is very straight with good gaps and we see the correct T5 badging on the fenders next to the red, white and blue galloping horse. Thin mustache-like chrome bumpers present well as does the grille surround and floating crosshair flanked corralled horse, and spear assembly. All brightwork is showing well and the freshman year Mustang cove is showing off proudly. For the back, the iconic dual trios of outward V shaped tail lights with nice bezels between each V, a centrally located large badged correct gas cap without the Mustang script and dual trumpet style exhaust tips in chrome. Correct blacked out 14-inch wheel covers are on all 4 corners and area wrapped in thin white stripe radial rubber. A shout out to the trunk with its super clean plaid mat and full sized spare tire. Interior Looking inside we are met with door panels covered in pristine black vinyl tuck and roll with black textured steel door frames, shiny chrome window cranks and door releases. Black standard vinyl buckets, are up front and a rear bench are keenly redone with no marks or tears. A chrome white ball topped Hurst shifter grows from the carpeted center hump. A dual eyebrowed dash pad sits atop the black full metal jacket dash which contains the original instrument cluster, various chrome knobs and sliders, AM radio, and black textured glove box door. A faux leather wrapped drilled 3 spoke wheel is perched atop the fixed steering column with the correct no Mustang script center gives a nice touch to all the black. A clean black carpet floods the floors and is protected by black rubber horse embossed mats while a black perforated vinyl headliner hangs above. Drivetrain A beautiful blinged out Ford black 289ci V8 sits comfortably in the black engine bay. This is not the original engine as it carries a C80E casting number, (see photo). The bling factor comes in the form of chrome valve covers, air cleaner assembly, and the correct export brace and added Monte Carlo bar. A Holley 4-barrel carburetor lurks under the air cleaner and handles the air and fuel mixture perfectly, sending it into the mill via a Weiand intake. Bolted to the rear of the mill is the correct Toploader 4-speed manual transmissionand out back is a Ford 8 rear axle with 2.80 gearing. Overall the engine bay presents as clean and well sorted. Undercarriage All good under here with no rust, all front suspension and steering components appear to be new with independent coil springs and disc brakes. Not to be outdone, the rear sports what appear to be new shocks and leaf springs and drum brakes provide thestopping power. Headers feed down to the dual exhaust which snakes its way rearward and is toned down by a pair of Flowmaster mufflers. Bringing up the rear is a new gas tank and the GT style chrome trumpet exhaust tips. We note a few patched repairs on the left front unibody rail. Drive-Ability The candles lit right up, running on all 8 cylinders, and gave us a real ride. No bucking bronco here very smooth from the well done restoration. All functions were operational at the time of our drive, oh and did I mention it's fast too! While Classic Auto Mall represents that these functions were working at the time of our test drive, we cannot guarantee these functions will be working at the time of your purchase. Keeping its original exterior color and original interior style and color, this consignor did a fab job on the add ons. Visually it's stunning, and speaking from the seat of my pants, it's powerful! The 1 year only color and all of the correct T5 components bring it right down to earth in a heavenly way. All original cars are cool, but this slightly tweaked in design and performance is definitely the way to go with a 1965 C-code Mustang...errrum T5 from across the pond. 5F07C345711 5-1965 F-Dearborn, MI Assy Plant 07-Mustang Hardtop C-289ci 200hp 2bbl V8 345711-Sequential Unit Number WARRANTY PLATE BODY "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Price is $80500.00"}]}

The 1967 Chevrolet Camaro, transformed into a Custom Speedster Show Car and christened the VXM-1 Viola Extreme Machine, is nothing short of an icon. Built by the legendary John Viola with no expense spared, this Camaro is a true one-of-a-kind marvel, designed to dazzle enthusiasts and collectors alike. Under the hood, this beast is powered by a 509 cubic inch Big Block Chevy engine, capable of producing a jaw-dropping 610 horsepower and 631 ft-lbs of torque. The TRQ aluminum heads, custom headers, and a hand-made 3-inch center-exit dual exhaust system with a crossover ensure that every ounce of power is delivered with precision. Paired with a Tremec TKO 5-speed transmission featuring a hydraulic clutch, and a Ford 9-inch rear end with 3 89 gears and a 1350 yoke True Track setup, this Camaro guarantees an exhilarating driving experience. Fueling this powerhouse is an 850 Demon carburetor complemented by an Aeromotive fuel system, while a March Performance billet drive belt ensures peak performance. A BeCool radiator and fans keep the engine cool under pressure, and the custom-made air cleaner with intricate airbrushing adds a touch of artistry to its raw power. The aluminum fuel cell and battery box, combined with a custom wiring system, further enhance reliability and precision. The VXM-1's chassis and suspension are equally remarkable. Featuring front and rear Detroit Speed & Engineering suspension, front tubular control arms, 2-inch drop spindles, Hotchkis springs and sway bars, and Koni front shocks, this Camaro is built to handle like a dream. The rear boasts a 4-link suspension system with adjustable coil-over shocks and chassis connectors, all tied together by a hidden roll bar. The Baer 4-wheel disc brakes, enhanced by a HYDRATECH brake system and a front line lock, ensure unparalleled stopping power. Inside, the craftsmanship is second to none. Custom Corbeau leather seats with a 5-way seat harness provide a perfect blend of comfort and safety. Leather adorns the door panels and dash, while the wrap-around center console offers a sleek, modern touch. The Flaming River tilt steering column with a Budnick steering wheel and Covan's Classic instrument cluster with Autometer gauges put control firmly in your hands. True to its race-inspired spirit, the car features a radio and heater delete, allowing the focus to remain on performance. The exterior is a showcase of custom touches. A custom hood, windshield cowl, header panel, and lower valance blend seamlessly with the reimagined front fenders and smooth firewall. Shaved and capped doors, billet mirrors, and a front bumper delete streamline the silhouette, while the power rear speedster top with an integrated third brake light adds a touch of innovation.

If you are in the market for a classic muscle car, you will not be disappointed with this car. This is a high-end complete restoration/restomod of 1971 Ford Mustang Mach-1 with Sportsroof.

The car has Ridler wheels and brand-new tires (installed 1/15/2025). Interior is in good condition and was restored Mach-1 correct. Undercarriage is in good condition. Known Flaws There is a slow draw on the power from the battery when the car is turned off. I've had a mechanic look into it and we think the issue is the aftermarket stereo. So we havedisconnected the stereo. However, the battery also has a battery power shutoff switch, that can be usedto avoid thebattery draw. Also, the windows do not seal completely and so when the car is washed some water leaks into the interior. I believe this is common with older cars. Also, there are small scratches on the paint in various locations on the car. I can send pictures of these things upon request. I have owned this car since May of 2022. I have enjoyed this car. I hate to see it go. I am selling it only to free up some cash. Category 1971_ford_mustang"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Price is $40775.00"}]}

Smith assembly line in Michigan. By 1968, the Shelby Mustang had reached a new level of maturity and refinement., described in Shelby advertising and literature as \u201cThe Road Car.\u201d No longer the loud and boisterous boy-racer of 1965, the fourth year of Carroll Shelby\u2019s Mustang offered a combination of performance, handling, comfort and distinctive styling, especially the stylized rollbar in the first regular production Shelby convertible. With design assistance from Ford, the 1968 Shelby\u2019s fiberglass panels were updated with a new nose with Lucas fog lights in the grille, hood with forward-placed twin scoops, and rear end with sequential 1965 Thunderbird taillights. While the standard Mustang big-block was a 390, the Shelby GT500 stepped up to a 360 HP 428 Police Interceptor with an aluminum high-rise intake manifold, 735 CFM Holley 4-barrel carburetor, open-element oval air cleaner and finned aluminum valve covers. The Mustang\u2019s woodgrain-trimmed Deluxe interior was enhanced by a special Shelby console with Stewart-Warner gauges and a thick, padded armrest with an embossed Shelby snake logo. Capable but smooth handling was provided by the Mustang\u2019s heavy-duty suspension that was updated to Shelby specs with unique progressive-rate springs, adjustable Gabriel shocks and a thicker front sway bar. Power steering and power front disc brakes were also part of the Shelby package. This beautiful Sunlit Gold 1968 Shelby GT500 Convertible is equipped with the popular 15-inch 10-spoke wheels. The Police Interceptor 428 and C6 3-speed automatic transmission were rebuilt in 2020 by Kemah Classic Automotive.
